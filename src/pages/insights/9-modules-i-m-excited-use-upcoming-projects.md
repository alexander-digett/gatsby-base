I love "shiny" new things, but I am also cautious and want to ensure I'm using things that are going to work well down the road. Here are a few Drupal projects I've been following and I'm excited about trying them out. Any input is very welcome!

1. [Masonry](https://www.drupal.org/project/masonry)
----------------------------------------------------

"Masonry is a dynamic grid layout plugin for jQuery." Pinterest has made this a very popular layout. I'm excited to try out the Views integration of this module. I love the idea of outputting a view in a dynamic grid rather than a list. If you have seen the layout of Pinterest, this is similar.

2. [Views infinite scroll](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_infinite_scroll)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the name implies, this module creates a pager for Views that allows your browser to load the next page of content as you scroll to the bottom of the page. No more waiting to click for the next ten results.

3. [qTip Tooltips](https://www.drupal.org/project/qtip)
-------------------------------------------------------

qTip is a nice module to enable easy, stylable tooltips. This module is great to easily add beautiful tooltips to social media links with text like "Follow us on Twitter", etc.

4. [Publish Content](https://www.drupal.org/project/publishcontent)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I like to give clients access to unpublish their own content, but I prefer not to give permission in Drupal to all the other functions that come with adding that permission to their role. This module allows a more granular permission for just the publish/unpublish function.

5. [View Unpublished](https://www.drupal.org/project/view_unpublished)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When I use the Publish Content module, I will need to allow users access to view unpublished nodes. It looks like this module performs this simple task perfectly.

6. [Fences](https://www.drupal.org/project/fences)
--------------------------------------------------

Fences enables a much cleaner HTML output from Drupal. You can specify the HTML output for each field in your content types. Cleaner, leaner code makes me happy.

7. [Link Checker](https://www.drupal.org/project/linkchecker)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great module to check your site before going live to ensure all your links are working. When your production URL is different than the development server, it can be very helpful to catch any accidental developmental addresses.

8. [Maxlength](https://www.drupal.org/project/maxlength)
--------------------------------------------------------

This plugin does one small thing and it does it well. I can make a text field countdown how many characters are left for the field. This enhances the usability in the admin interface for my clients.

9. [Plupload Widget](https://www.drupal.org/project/plup)
---------------------------------------------------------

I have been searching this year for a usable way to upload multiple files/images to Drupal. I have used various Flickr integrations and I've not been happy with the results. I really like that this module lets you choose all the images you want on a node and upload all of them at once using the open source Plupload library.

What do you think?
------------------

Do you have any challenges or successes with these modules? I would love to discuss them. Or, are there modules you want to try out?
