 I’m not being narcissistic — that's an actual compliment from a client. At first it made for a good laugh, but the more I think about it the more I realize our client was right: our team works to save the world from bad marketing and websites. And we do it together.

I’m not being narcissistic — that's an actual compliment from a client. At first it made for a good laugh, but the more I think about it the more I realize our client was right: our team works to save the world from bad marketing and websites. And we do it together.

Mark - Superman
---------------

The head of our tight-knit team, dedicated and honest, with a strong moral compass. Mark does his utmost (just shy of leaping tall buildings) to do what’s right and best for Digett’s clients and the team.

JD - Batman
-----------

Our head developer relies on strategic thinking, deductive reasoning, and a grab bag of nifty tools and tricks to get the job done. His driving passion isn’t revenge, but the best possible websites for our clients.

Valarie - Wonder Woman
----------------------

Digett’s quick-thinking, ever-calm ambassador. Her insistence on fair dealings and equal treatment mean excellent things for our clients, and her super-hearing and attention to detail helps her figure out exactly what our clients need and want.

Amy - Hawkgirl
--------------

Need help spotting typos, inconsistencies, or potential challenges? Look no further than Amy. The devil’s in the details, after all, and nothing stops a spliced comma or misplaced modifier faster than this writer and her trusty red pen.

Digett League to the rescue!
----------------------------

Okay, so maybe that’s a little too much. But we’re always excited to help growth-oriented organizations take their marketing to the next level.
