[TRC Consultants](http://www.phdwin.com) has enjoyed favorable market share for a number of years with its powerful PHDWin suite of software for the petroleum industry. As part of a recent international expansion, TRC translated PHDWin into Russian and renamed the regional product offering [PHD Precise](http://phdprecise.com).

To educate their target audience, TRC needed to reach out in bilingual fashion with a website. Digett's job was to combine supplied copy and graphics with Drupal plumbing and a solid Rackspace network, and enabling multilingual support, hence launching TRC's multinational web presence. There were two main tasks:

### Provide Language Toggling in Drupal  

[Language barriers](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-content/is-web-content-localization-a-race-to-the-bottom-003446.php) would curtail TRC's effort to put useful information in the hands of Moscow decision-makers. Every page of the site prominently features the ability to toggle between English and Russian.

We'll note (it may not be obvious) that the site isn't a translation engine; TRC and their international marketing partner provided us with Russian content (Our Russian is rusty. _Da_!).

To make this work, we leveraged the power of [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and its [multi-lingual capabilities](http://drupal.org/node/290), added to Drupal _core_ with the release of version 6.

### TRC Consultants' Participation in Moscow Conference

A primary goal for the site was to promote PHDPrecise's presence at the [Society of Petroleum Engineers](http://www.spe.org) Russian [Oil and Gas Technical Conference and Exhbition](http://www.russianoilgas.com/) in Moscow last month. Since the site launch was to coincide with the conference, we showcased PHDPrecise's participation with an announcement in a sidebar on each page. It kept the information easily accessible everywhere a user clicked. We hear their booth was busy all weekend.

With its flexibility to serve both Russian- and English-speaking audiences, PHDPrecise.com provides a view into Drupal's power and flexibility and serves as an effective platform for generating new business leads.
