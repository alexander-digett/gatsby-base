 A week from tomorrow I and a couple other marketing professionals will be talking to San Antonio business owners and marketers at an event hosted by the North San Antonio Chamber as part of their Business How-To Series. I’m excited about this event because opportunities to proselytize for the cause of inbound marketing to a crowd with so much to gain are few and far between. To help convince the skeptics, I’ve come up with five reasons that San Antonio business owners and marketers should consider this a must-attend event.

A week from tomorrow I and a couple other marketing professionals will be talking to San Antonio business owners and marketers at an event hosted by the North San Antonio Chamber as part of their Business How-To Series. I’m excited about this event because opportunities to proselytize for the cause of inbound marketing to a crowd with so much to gain are few and far between. To help convince the skeptics, I’ve come up with five reasons that San Antonio business owners and marketers should consider this a must-attend event.

Reason #5. It’s not just about marketing. It’s about _inbound marketing._
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inbound marketing is not just a fad. It’s how world-class organizations are succeeding in today’s marketplace. So this distinction is not trivial. You’ll read more about this in a moment.

Reason #4. These speakers are at the top of their game.
-------------------------------------------------------

I swear I’m not one to toot my own horn, much to my mother’s dismay. But if I were going to assemble a team in San Antonio to speak authoritatively on the topic of inbound marketing, I can’t imagine a better one, and I imagine that’s what Steve Patti, Chief Marketing Officer at Peer1, thought when he organized the panel. I’ve successfully led my firm, Digett, through ten years of what can be classified as no less than a revolution in marketing. The web has changed everything, some might say, and in short order. At Digett we’ve made enough mistakes in that time to pave a four-lane road to hell, and that education has been priceless.

Ryan Kelly of PearAnalytics, another of Tuesday’s presenters, is an SEO expert of almost legendary status in San Antonio. Not only does he know everybody who is somebody in marketing, he has reinvented himself time and time again to stay on the edge of what’s happening in the industry, and is highly respected in his field. I dare you to try to stump him on a question that’s anywhere within his domain. He’s just brilliant that way.

Hailing from New York originally—with a down-to-business attitude to prove it—Jessica Massay has done more in her career of 12 years than most marketing professionals accomplish in a lifetime. Her forte is building buyer personas, one of the most important and least understood aspects of successfully going to market. She is the epitome of a professional, and her presentation will surely have the audience wanting more.

Reason #3. Inbound marketing is your best shot at growing your business.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just pop your head into virtually any conversation among the country’s top tier of marketing experts and you’re 99% likely to hear something about the topic of inbound marketing. Not billboards, not radio... hell, not really much about advertising at all. Today it’s all about content marketing, inbound marketing, lead generation and nurturing. All the hype about Facebook and Twitter often overlooks the fact that social media is at its best when part of an effective inbound marketing strategy.

Reason #2. Your competition will be there.
------------------------------------------

Even if they’re not actually at the event, your competition will be able to see most, if not all, of the presentation materials online. And they’ll likely have access to some freebies, among which will be the “how-to” mind map I’ve been assembling over the last year or two. Of course it’s not the same as being there, but that’s the whole point. By being there in person, you’ll be in the front of the pack.

Reason #1. You’ll be compelled (and equipped) to make changes that positively impact your business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can’t speak for the other two presenters, but I have a pretty good idea that, like me, they’re focused on giving something away that listeners can take home with them. My goal is not only to inspire you through enlightenment, but to equip you with some tools and techniques that you can take back to your office and put to work... as in _today_.

See you there

The breakfast kicks off Tuesday, August 30 at 8am at the Hilton San Antonio - Airport. It’s a 2-hour program followed by an hour of free consultation. If you are not a member of the chamber but would like to attend, you’re in luck. The How 2 Series is open to both members and non-members alike, and at the same bargain of $15 each. The breakfast alone is worth that much! Parking is free.
