Fresh on the heels of our [recent move to San Antonio](http://www.digett.com/blog/09/24/2012/digett-office-moving), we are excited to announce that our staff is growing as well! Joining the Digett family is Jeff Lamboy as its Strategic Marketing & Communication Director and Jonathan Dale as its Senior Web Developer / Architect.

What do they do?
----------------

Jeff is responsible for the development and execution of all strategic marketing programs and communication campaigns, including digital marketing, social media, and public relations. Jonathan is responsible for leading web development efforts while bringing knowledge leadership and expertise as a collaborator in the Drupal community.

"The addition of Jeff and Jonathan represents a leap forward for Digett," says Mark Figart, Founder and President. "The two bring over 30 years of combined experience, best practices, and new perspectives to our marketing and web development efforts. I think there is a great blend of skills there that will prove ideal for extending our company's influence."

How Rackspace played a part
---------------------------

Prior to joining Digett, Jeff worked in Strategic Marketing Initiatives at Rackspace Hosting and served as the founding program manager for the Rackspace Startup Program. He graduated from the University of Denver with a Master’s degree in Communication (Marketing & PR) and a Bachelor’s degree in Business from the University of the Incarnate Word.

Another Rackspace Hosting alum, Jonathan worked as a Level III Linux Systems Administrator on the International Support Team. He also founded the San Antonio Drupal Users Group and he has been recognized as the 2008-2009 Rawlinson Innovator of the Year by the Northside Education Foundation.
