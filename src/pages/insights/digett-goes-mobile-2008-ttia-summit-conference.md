summary: > 
 I couldn't be happier about representing Digett at this year's Texas Travel Summit (September 21-24), hosted by the Texas Travel Industry Association. For starters, I haven't been to Galveston since I was a kid, and I'm itching to erase the memory of a brutal sunburn. Better yet, I'll be bringing many of you with me.

I couldn't be happier about representing Digett at this year's Texas Travel Summit (September 21-24), hosted by the Texas Travel Industry Association. For starters, I haven't been to Galveston since I was a kid, and I'm itching to erase the memory of a brutal sunburn. Better yet, I'll be bringing many of you with me.

No, I'm not springing for plane tickets. I am, however, offering everyone an opportunity to experience the conference with me through the use of several online tools—tools that anyone can effectively use to connect with and engage the markets and individuals they seek. From blogs, to Twitter posts, to photo uploads to Flickr, I'll be doing it all.

This isn't just an exercise in how much coffee and ginseng I can consume to keep me going. It's an opportunity for you to participate—as actively as you wish—in an event that may be hundreds of miles away. It's also a way for you to experiment with communication tools that allow you to bring authentic conversation back to an increasingly isolated business world.

If you think that's a little more exciting than late-night reruns, then check back here to get the latest details and updates about how you can come along. In the meantime, check out the first part of our ongoing blog series about social media featuring Twitter, one of the tools I'll be using at the conference.
