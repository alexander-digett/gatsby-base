I love writing, but it’s a tough gig. Relying on blogging “inspiration” is a terrible strategy, so you have to get used to knuckling down and just getting it done — and getting it done _right_.

Few writers and marketers did it better than David Ogilvy, a Manhattan advertising executive many called “The Father of Advertising.” He changed advertising and marketing the way the wheel changed long-distance travel.

Writing tips from David Ogilvy
------------------------------

In September 1982, Ogilvy sent the following memo to everyone on staff at his agency:

_“The better you write, the higher you go in Ogilvy & Mather. People who think well, write well._

_Woolly minded people write woolly memos, woolly letters and woolly speeches._

_Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well. Here are 10 hints:_

1.  _Read the [Roman-Raphaelson book on writing](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Works-Communicate-Effectively-Business/dp/0060956437). Read it three times._
2.  _Write the way you talk. Naturally._
3.  _Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs._
4.  _Never use jargon words like reconceptualize,demassification, attitudinally, judgmentally. They are hallmarks of a pretentious ass._
5.  _Never write more than two pages on any subject._
6.  _Check your quotations._
7.  _Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning — and then edit it._
8.  _If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it._
9.  _Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do._
10.  _If you want ACTION, don’t write. Go and tell the guy what you want.”_

These rules are solid gold, and should be painted in gigantic letters on the wall in every marketer’s office.

Think well, write well
----------------------

Writing is just as much science as art; I rely on Ogilvy’s memo to provide the science and the story of what I’m writing to provide the art.

Great writing makes marketing better, consumers happier, and the world a better place.
