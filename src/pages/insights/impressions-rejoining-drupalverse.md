“Hi, my name is JD and I'm a noob.” That's how I feel I should start every conversation as I dive back into a world where every question I ask takes me deeper and deeper into the guts of Drupal.

But at least I'm no noob when it comes to web design/development. I have a stupid joke I tell almost every client: I tell people that Al Gore introduced me to the internet back in '92. It is a good ice breaker and sets the stage that I have been at this since the pioneer days.

Since that time, I've walked where we've all walked: I've used FrontPage (gasp), I've written my own CMS, and then I saw the light about 10 years ago and started using CMSs written by other people. I've used Typo3, Wordpress, Expression Engine, WebGUI, Mambo/Joomla, and many many many more. I think I've used all of them. During those early days, I also explored Drupal development. If you look at [my Drupal.org accoun](https://www.drupal.org/user/3054)t, you will see I've been lurking in the community for over 8 years.

I left Drupal several years ago because of its complexity; I'm coming back now because I need that the complexity to enable flexibility in what I can create. I'm tired of hacking CMSs to do what I need; I love that Drupal can do anything I've thrown at it (so far).

Thoughts on Drupal vs. the others
---------------------------------

Here are some random thoughts as I dive back into the Drupalverse.

Drupal is:

*   much more flexible than Wordpress — I love being able to create my own content types
*   ...also more difficult to theme than Wordpress
*   more configurable than Expression Engine
*   more likely to be able to meet any client need
*   even better than BuddyPress for community sites

Resources to learn Drupal
-------------------------

Here are some resources I've found helpful in returning to Drupal:

*   Google. I love that someone has probably already asked and answered almost every question I ask
*   [Drupal.org's guide](https://www.drupal.org/node/258) (Always helpful to get information from the source)
*   This [list of 100+ Drupal views tutorials and resources](http://www.drupalove.com/article/100-drupal-views-tutorials-and-resources) (very helpful list of how-tos for Drupal, mostly Drupal 6)
*   Acquia’s post on [how to learn Drupal](https://dev.acquia.com/blog/how-learn-drupal) (I loved reading this)
*   and my coworkers

What about you?
---------------

I would love to hear from you: Do you have any resources that would help a programmer get back into Drupal?
