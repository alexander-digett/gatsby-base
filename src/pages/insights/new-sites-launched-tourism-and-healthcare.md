Digett prides itself on helping companies establish brands and providing marketing solutions. Whether we’re there for the birth of a brand, as with The Inn at Bella Vista, MedMarketers, and BioSafe, or helping to redefine existing offerings, as with Instrument Specialists and X Bar Ranch, we flex our skills and technology muscles to empower companies with the websites they need.

Instrument Specialists
----------------------

[![Image removed.](/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg "This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed.")Instrument Specialists, Inc.](http://www.isisurgery.com/products/) (ISI) out of Boerne, Texas specializes in providing hand-surgery tables and accessories to the medical industry, as well as medical equipment-repair services.

While their legacy site reflected both aspects of their business, ISI came to Digett to update the half of their site where customers browse products. Previously, their website let users view all products and descriptions, but the only way customers could place an order was via phone or fax.

ISI’s new product website lets users place an order directly online. Digett also worked with ISI to develop new granular and logical categories for products to make browsing easier. On top of that, the bottom of every product page features related products, as defined by ISI, so they can promote the sale of additional items and make it easier for customers to find other products they’ll likely need.

Goals for a phase 2 of the project include full shipping, credit card, and possible QuickBooks integration. While ISI’s home page and service-centric parts of their site remain static HTML, their new products interface uses our [CMS of choice, Drupal](/2009/01/22/drupal-selling-points). The ease of adding and editing products themselves has already saved ISI time and money.

The Inn at Bella Vista
----------------------

[![Image removed.](/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg "This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed.")The Inn at Bella Vista](http://bellavistafbg.com/) is a small bed and breakfast 15 minutes east of Fredericksburg, Texas. Through images of the property, along with a gentle color scheme, this site and new Digett-designed logo accentuate the relaxed environment of Bella Vista.

Users can keep track of happenings and connect with Bella Vista’s owners, Paula and Gary Sanders, by:

*   Reading their [blog](http://bellavistafbg.com/happenings) or subscribing to their [RSS feed](http://bellavistafbg.com/happenings/rss.xml)
*   Following them on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/InnatBellaVista)
*   [Becoming a fan](http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Inn-at-Bella-Vista/372134511603) on Facebook (”Like” them directly from the sidebar of the site.)

If their posts and pictures whet the the palate, users can book a stay via the Reserve a Room button, prominent on every page.

X Bar Ranch Nature Retreat
--------------------------

[![Image removed.](/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg "This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed.")](http://www.xbarranch.com)If you’re looking for a good place to gather as a group a little farther out in West Texas, consider [X Bar Ranch Nature Retreat](http://www.xbarranch.com/). X Bar hosts a wide range of activities from weddings, family reunions, and astronomy “star parties” to hiking, cycing, mountain biking, and hunting.

Since X Bar welcomes such a variety of visitors, we worked to highlight the three most-important and actively desired group types prominently on the home page. We’ve made other activity types easily accessible, both through navigation as well as a listing in the site’s footer, so every user can see all that X Bar has to offer.

Part of the redesign process of the website also included a redesign of their logo to better reflect the ranch’s mix of rustic comfort, “modern country,” and their connection to nature. Though the original “x” and “bar” cattle brand is no longer part of the logo, it’s still a small visual accent sprinkled throughout the site.

MedMarketers
------------

[![Image removed.](/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg "This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed.")MedMarketers](http://www.medmarketers.com/) is a group of senior-level marketers working with heathcare providers to engage current and potential patients via digital and grassroots marketing efforts. This website introduces users to MedMarketers and their [methodology](http://www.medmarketers.com/methodology), which combines branding, connection, engagement, and measurement to grow referrals.

The layered web design and Digett-created logo give a professional polish to this endeavor. Since MedMarketers’ focus is on engagement, the site prominently features phone and email contact information on every page.

BioSafe Solutions
-----------------

[![Image removed.](/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg "This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed.")BioSafe](http://www.biosafe-solutions.com/) is a zero-toxicity sanitizing product that “kills mold, bacteria and other pathogens found in HVAC systems and on surfaces.” It can remove and prevent a variety of threats, including H1N1, MRSA, or anthrax.

The new BioSafe website provides detailed documentation about the product, including EPA test results and well as independent [lab test reports](http://www.biosafe-solutions.com/technical-resources). It addresses two audience groups: professionals needing services and those wishing to include BioSafe as part of their company’s cleaning offerings. A contact form and applicable documentation is available on every page.

Like the logo of parent company [Action Restoration](http://www.action-restoration.com) (whose website [launched in early April](/2010/04/05/new-site-launch-trifecta)), BioSafe’s logo is a Digett creation.
