 I think I’ve spent more time editing than I have with my husband. Such is the lot of a person who dedicates her career to stamping out crappy content. In the rush to produce the content "they" say we have to, I worry that we’re skimping on making sure that content is correct.

I think I’ve spent more time editing than I have with my husband. Such is the lot of a person who dedicates her career to stamping out crappy content. In the rush to produce the content “they” say we have to, I worry that we’re skimping on making sure that content is correct.

Has this ever happened to you?
------------------------------

The inspiration for this article comes from Taylor Mali, a teacher and slam poet known for his grammar- and word-inspired poems. (Warning: Some NSFW language.)

Mali’s poem goes over-the-top, but the point holds true: proofreading is critical to creating successful content.

Why proofreading matters
------------------------

Crappy content makes your business (and by extension, you) look crappy.

Visually pleasing, well-researched, grammatically correct content, on the other hand, indicates your professionalism and close attention to detail — not to mention your subject matter expertise.

Creating excellent content is one of the best ways you have to establish a trustworthy online reputation. Don’t blow it by not checking your work.

4 rules of proofreading
-----------------------

In his poem Mali lists two rules to keep in mind while proofreading — let’s break those down a little and throw in my favorites for good measure.

### There is no substitute for careful editing

Drafting your content on a computer with spellcheck is a great way to catch the easy mistakes, but as noted in Mali’s poem, they’re not infallible. Double- and triple-check your content for repeated words, synonyms, and grammatical issues your computer can’t see.

Protip: Ask someone else to proofread your work. It’s amazing what a fresh pair of eyes can catch even after you’ve read through something multiple times.

### The red pen is your friend

Another way to catch errors you might miss staring at your content on a screen is to print out your text and go through it “manually.” The new medium will give you a fresh perspective and help your brain spot issues you might not have before.

### Put together a style guide

The purpose of a style guide is to help those writing content for your business to do so in a consistent way over time.

It doesn’t need to be anything fancy, just an easily accessible document that provides rules like:

*   Whether or not to use the Oxford comma
*   Whether content should be in first or third person
*   Whether percentages should be _20%_ or _20 percent_

This document makes it easy for you to keep your own writing consistent, and gives guest bloggers or freelancers creating content for you a guide to follow so that all your content is consistent.

### It’s all about the reader

Wanna know a dirty secret about editing? **Rules matter less than readability**. If a grammatically incorrect sentence makes sense and clearly gets your point across to the reader, you can chuck any editing out the window.

This idea is sacrilegious to many editors — myself included — but it actually makes life easier. Instead of obsessing over semicolons and _Should there be a comma here?_ all I have to do is ask, “Does this confuse the reader?” and let my intuition lead the way.

Resources for editors (and writers)
-----------------------------------

No matter how long you’ve been writing and editing, there’s always room for improvement. Here’s a few books I’ve found helpful in that process.

*   _Writing That Works: How to Communicate Effectively in Business_ (3rd edition, Kenneth Roman and Joel Raphaelson)
*   _The Subversive Copy Editor; or, How to Negotiate Good Relationships with Your Writers, Your Colleagues, and Yourself_ (Carol Fisher Saller)
*   _The Copyeditor’s Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications_ (3rd edition, Amy Einsohn)
