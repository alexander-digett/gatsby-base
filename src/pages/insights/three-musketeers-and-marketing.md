Last week I finally gave up on trying to read Alexandre Dumas’ classic novel _The Three Musketeers_. It was a valiant effort, but in the end it just wasn’t worth the confusion. Reading felt vaguely like torture, so I sent the tale packing. What does this have to do with marketing, you ask? Excellent question!

I love reading, but I gave up on _The Three Musketeers_ for the same reasons I give up on doing business with a company: I couldn’t tell who anyone is, what they were doing, or why they were doing it.

Who are you?
------------

The titular musketeers are Aramis, Athos, and Porthos. Dumas didn’t do a great job of describing them physically, and they all behave similarly — if you asked me to list a defining feature of any of them, I’d be at a loss.

**Who is your company? What sets you apart?** If you look and behave like everyone else, you’ll blend into the crowd and be forgotten.

What do you do?
---------------

_The Three Musketeers_ was particularly frustrating to me because I could never figure out the plot. When I got to page 156 (of over 600) and I _still_ didn’t know what was happening, I threw in the towel.

**What’s your objective, and can you state it clearly?** If I come to your website or read your printed promotional material and I can’t understand what you do, something’s wrong; if I get almost a quarter of the way through your website or your sales pitch and can’t articulate your business objectives, something needs to change or I’m going to disappear.

Why do you do it?
-----------------

Dumas’ musketeers didn’t seem to have much reasoning behind their actions. Why do they hate Cardinal Richelieu so much? Why do they insist on dueling and killing everyone they meet?

**Why do you do what you do?** Why are your recommendations and actions what they are? The word “transparency” is thrown around a lot, but it’s important — if I can’t make sense of your business practices or recommendations, I’m not likely to follow them.

The moral of the story
----------------------

In marketing, as in reading, being clear matters. Are you making an effort to stand apart and state clearly what you do and why, or are people giving up on you a quarter of the way through?
