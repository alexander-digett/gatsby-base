Our internship program is in its third semester, and we’re happy to have a great group of ladies with us this spring. Their first day was in January, and we’ve already got them involved in numerous client projects.

Divya Chinchinada - Developer
-----------------------------

![](/assets/divya-chinchinada_0.jpg)Divya recently graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Science from St. Mary’s University. She’s got strong programming skills, and we’re dropping her into as many Drupal build projects as we can.

Jennifer Edwards - Marketer
---------------------------

![](/assets/jennifer-edwards.png)Jen is a junior at Trinity University, interested in Business Administration, Communication, and Marketing. Her previous internship experience and sharp eye for copyediting make her a great addition to the team.

Gabrielle Kinderknecht - Designer
---------------------------------

![](/assets/gabrielle-kinderknecht_0.png)If Gabie seems familiar, it’s because she was one of our Fall 2013 interns. We like her so much and her skills are so top-notch that we asked her to stick around for one more semester!

What’s next?
------------

Over the next few months we’ll have these three knee-deep in code, designing email templates and print pieces, creating scripts and storyboards, adding to their portfolios, and — of course — blogging.

We’re excited to be working with such great students, and look forward to all they are able to accomplish this semester.
