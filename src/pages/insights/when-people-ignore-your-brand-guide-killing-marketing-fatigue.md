Perhaps you liked a new local coffee shop’s Facebook page because they have great lattes. However their posts are centering around your town’s night life and the intern’s Instagram food photos. Unlike.

Where is the value to the consumer? Are we meeting him in his terms? What he wants to see and when he wants to see it? Let’s make this about him, and less about patting ourselves on the back for how often we can post or email.

Email
-----

Court your new email prospects conservatively. Your messages should be simple and straight-forward. Make it personal; send the first mini campaign from your own business email account. You’re aiming for your recipients to value your relationship and position yourself as their own go-to source of contact. It helps to keep an eye on your analytics (open rates, unsubscribes, engagement, spikes, and dips). If what you’re doing isn’t working, change it!

Blogging/Content
----------------

When it comes to blogging, keep an ear out for what your audience wants to see. Ask yourself who will help spread your content. And what’s in it for them? Remember, we care that one person loves your content, but 1,000 people sweetens the deal.

Social Media
------------

Tread lightly on social media. We still need to go there, but a little insider tip: Facebook pays attention when your posts aren’t successful and will de-promote your content accordingly. If you’re new to marketing your brand on social media, it may serve you well to test your content on Twitter first. Twitter’s algorithm is much simpler and doesn’t discriminate less successful posts. Regardless of your social road of choice, your main goal is engagement--shares, likes, reposts, comments, and tags. Watch those stats diligently, and reap your conversion rewards.
