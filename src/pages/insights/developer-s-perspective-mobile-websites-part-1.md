Andrew posted an article on [Mobile Website Design](/insights/mobile-website-design) this week. In it, he talks about a designer's perspective on the mobile audience. From a _development_ perspective, mobile website development is a breath of fresh air. As I began writing, I realized I touched on a topic of interest to me, and I hope you. I'm planning to break this up with a different piece of this mobile topic each week for several weeks.

Here is my plan for the direction of these blog posts over the next couple of weeks:

*   Usability and what kind of site you are creating
*   HTML/CSS slicing can finally use modern code
*   Which platforms/devices do you target
*   Special mobile considerations for site design/development

So, here we go. First up, let's talk about usability and how to determine what kind of mobile site you need.

Usability
---------

When designing a mobile site, it is vital that you consider if you are creating a task-based/mobile app or a "mobilized" version of the website. They will take the design in two different directions.

### Task-based site

If my audience will most likely use the mobile site to perform a few tasks, then a task-based approach works well. In this scenario, we provide a simple interface to quickly get the visitor to the task they desire: look up a location nearby, complete a form, scan your latest headlines, etc.

### Mobilized site

If the mobile site I want provides information about my product or service, but users don't need to perform a task, a mobilized site might be the answer. In this scenario I have two choices: I can simply ensure the site is mobile-friendly, or I can provide a scaled-back design that provides access to most of my site content.

### Mobile-friendly site

The most economical approach is to depend on the user interacting with my site using the smartphone's zoom features. I can let the user double-tap to zoom into the content of the page. With this approach, I simply ensure I'm using compatible technologies. I need to:

*   Eliminate my use of Flash (not supported by iPhone/iPad)
*   Ensure my code is well-organized, clean and modern
*   Provide clear navigation and follow UI/UX best practices

### Scaled-back design

The idea here is to allow access to all or most of the content of your site. **Create a design that is complementary to your main site, but simplify navigation, search and content presentation.** This solution is especially helpful for news or blog sites.

Next time, let's talk about Â special considerations when designing/development for mobile.
