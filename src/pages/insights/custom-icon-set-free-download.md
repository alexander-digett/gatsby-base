I've written recently about icons in web design, a trend that doesn't appear to be going out of style anytime soon. With sites like [iStockPhoto.com](http://www.istockphoto.com) and [IconFinder.com](https://www.iconfinder.com/) offering thousands for download, it's clear there is no shortage of icons depicting any subject.

Custom Icons
------------

However, in my experience, there are times when that perfect icon can't be found, or simply doesn't exist. I've had several instances where I've had to create an icon for a very specific use case.

My Design Process
-----------------

I usually start by studying photographs and existing icons that are similar to that which I'm trying to create. Then I "sketch" it in Photoshop; that is, create a bitmap rendering of the icon. I push pixels around until I've got what I think looks good.

Once the pixels are in place, I begin to trace my drawing with paths as a way of vectorizing the icon. A vector-based icon is ideal because it can be re-sized easily, and made smaller or larger without distortion or pixelation of the image.

I then save the vector art as a custom shape and name it appropriately. And anytime in the future I need call on my custom icon, I grab it from my dropdown menu and plop it on the canvas. Voil√†!

Free Download
-------------

Like I said, over the years I've collected a few custom icons, and now I'm going to share a few with you. Please don't hesitate to download my free custom icon set, for use as you see fit. Yes, they're a bit random but what makes them a set is the fact that I designed each of them for a specific purpose, hopefully so you don't have to. Enjoy!
