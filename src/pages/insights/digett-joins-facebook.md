You’ve seen our blog, you [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/Digett), now join Digett on Facebook! That’s right, the [Digett Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/Digett) is up and running, and now the only thing we need to make it complete is you!

Why join?
---------

Both our Twitter account and this blog are great places to learn about web design and inbound marketing. And while each of our bloggers has a pretty distinct writing “voice,” there’s not always a lot of room for personality in a business blog.

That’s where our Facebook Page comes in. There we give you a behind-the-scenes look at [who we are](/who-we-are/key-players), and all the fun we have while creating some seriously awesome websites. We ask and answer questions, share links to content we think is funny or meaningful, give you sneak peeks of upcoming projects, and share a little bit more about ourselves than we do on our blog.

We also periodically add imagery and our thought processes behind some of our favorite design and branding projects. **If you want to see the cream of the Digett design crop, you should definitely be our fan on Facebook.**

How to join
-----------

Easy as pie. Just head over to the [Digett Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/Digett), sign in to your Facebook account, and click the “Like” button next to our name.

We can’t wait to get to know you better!
