Not too long ago, our custom web design for [Boerne Wild West Day](http://www.boernewildwestday.com) was featured in a Smashing Magazine article — [Showcase Of Beautiful Textured Web Designs](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/showcase-of-beautiful-textured-web-designs/).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My personal favorite is our design of [The Little Black Dress Society](https://lbdsociety.org/) and the design community seems to share my enthusiasm. Since it's launch in Summer 2010 this custom web design has been featured in over 25 galleries resulting in over 35,000 site visits. Our spotlight over at [TheBestDesigns.com](http://www.thebestdesigns.com/2010/12/26/little-black-dress-society/) has single-handedly contributed 10,541 visits to the running total. Another 5,000 visits can be attributed to our feature in a Line25 article — [20 Examples of Creative Slideshows in Web Design](http://line25.com/articles/20-examples-of-creative-slideshows-in-web-design).

Who's Next?

It's fascinating that a website can attract so many eyeballs simply based on the way it looks. Throw on top an effective inbound marketing strategy and even a small percentage of those impressions could turn into big business for your company. Design matters at Digett and we want our next design to be even better than the last. Is it you?
