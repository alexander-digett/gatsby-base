It's clear that web pages, on average, are growing in size. So says a [recent report on websiteoptimization.com](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/average-web-page/). Larger web pages take longer to load, and the slower the connection, the longer the load time. Some might be quick to point out [another report](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/bw/0804/) that says broadband penetration among active internet users has grown to almost 90%. Taken alone, this might be construed as a green light for the ongoing growth of page size. The [same report](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/bw/0804/), however, also says that broadband reaches about 57% of all U.S. households. One might surmise that the majority of these households fall into lower income brackets. But rural households often have little or no access to a high-speed service, and Texas Hill Country dwellers, for example, know that rural often does not mean lower income.

Consider your intended audience and the possible consequences of a user experience characterized by slow-loading pages before you plunge into a major web marketing investment.
