The past couple of years have been dominated by businesses emphasizing their social media presence; but in a recent _New York Times_ article, author Melinda Emerson reminds us that [it's blogging that builds your business](http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/blogging-to-build-your-business/).

The ROI battle
--------------

While it is true that social media can drive traffic, a blog is essential to building your content platform. [Debate continues](http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2221153/finding-the-roi-in-social-media-no-silver-bullet) over the ROI for the amount of time spent on social media, and tracking performance can feel like trying to nail Jello to a tree.

The metrics and measures around blogging are precise. You can easily measure and evaluate unique visitors, comments, interactions, and time spent on your site. These metrics also give great insight into your customers’ interests and their needs.

Social media is a great way to promote the content that you write on your blog. It’s a great way to engage with your customers. It just shouldn’t be the center of your strategy.

Your blog is branded in strategy
--------------------------------

While blogging has an established history, it is constantly evolving. Looking to the future, there is now more emphasis on brand focus. Companies have produced branded content—volumes of it—but the results have lacked a clear and evident strategy.

Taking the time to develop a clear content plan and editorial calendar based on defined objectives will deliver a long-term benefit for those companies that plan and execute accordingly.

By establishing the primary content and writing tone of your blog, you will be less tempted by hot topics and current trends. While these subjects are temporarily engaging, you want to attract a larger audience, one that will utilize your blog as a resource over and over again.

Meet the challenge
------------------

Blogging consistently is challenging, and developing a focused strategy and sticking to it isn’t easy — which is why there are so many company blogs that haven’t been updated since 2009.
