Van Delden Wastewater Systems (Van Delden) is a family-owned and operated company specializing in the design, installation, repair, maintenance, and inspection of all types of septic systems in the South Texas area since 1937. They came to Digett for a new website to update their look and to serve as a better vehicle for their ongoing marketing activities.

Welcome the new [vdwws.com](http://www.vdwws.com/).

Fresh Design
------------

The previous site design for Van Delden was several years old. We modernized the look and feel of the website while maintaining those pieces most important to the Van Delden family and their customers.

*   Pictures of the family remain prominent on the home page. When you call Van Delden, you speak to a Van Delden. Thanks to the website, you’ll know what he or she looks like too.
*   The new home page gives an at-a-glance overview of all the VDWWS services, keeping things visually interesting while making it easy for visitors to find what they need.

Mobile-Friendly Web Design
--------------------------

[We’ve said it before](/insights/why-your-company-needs-mobile-website), but mobile traffic continues to rise and can’t be ignored when considering the future of your web presence.

Even though their previous site didn’t specifically cater to a mobile audience in any way, in the month before launch, 26% of traffic on vdwws.com came from a mobile-device. That's a significant number and we wanted to make sure to address the mobile audience. Now we’ve optimized the site for mobile, making the site easier to use on smaller screens.

The new [vdwws.com](http://www.vdwws.com/) is a responsive web design, meaning the same website is smart enough to serve up an ideal viewing experience for desktop, tablet and mobile-devices.

Better vehicle for ongoing marketing activities
-----------------------------------------------

In addition to their new website, we’re helping Van Delden generate more sales leads through a number of marketing activities. We’re helping them blog regularly and develop videos to reinforce their position as a knowledgeable and trusted leader in their field.

One of the tools to help us better speak to their audience is integration with InfusionSoft CRM. We’re segmenting the names and email addresses of their customers and sales leads to help us target their audiences with information that really interests them. Ongoing communication helps us keep their current customers coming back and helps us stir sales leads that may have gone cold.

Since the site launched, we’ve seen an improvement in overall traffic thanks to a better search engine optimized infrastructure and design and our ongoing marketing efforts. We’re excited about our continued work with VDWWS to help their business continue to grow.
