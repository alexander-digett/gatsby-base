I'm a web designer by trade, and as part of my job I think it's important to keep up with what's trending in our industry. **One of the hottest fads in web design today is creating and using icons**.

As I see them, icons are small, graphical representations of larger concepts. In web design, they're most often used to communicate ideas more efficiently. Where a written phrase is a horse, an icon is a cheetah â€” smaller and faster.

The web is full of icons, available to represent virtually everything from aliens to sandwiches. Websites like [iconfinder.com](https://www.iconfinder.com/) offer free icons for download, while [iStockphoto](http://www.istockphoto.com) sells some really nice, inexpensive sets.

However, there are some icons that can be hard to find, or simply don't exist. For example, an icon set that represents San Antonio, Texas could be hard to find. Well that may have been true before today, but it's all about to change.

I've designed five icons that represent San Antonio and I'm offering them up as a free download. This layered Photoshop Document (PSD) has five vector icons for use as you see fit. Simply click the image below to start the download and enjoy! And if you're so inclined, we'd love you to provide a link back to this post via your website, Twitter or Facebook account. And if you're really feeling ambitious_,_ **leave me a comment letting me know how you found us**. Thanks and happy day!
