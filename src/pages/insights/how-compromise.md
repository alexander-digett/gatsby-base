I love it when someone as typically elegant and gracious as Seth takes such a cynically facetious slant. In Friday's [post on the subject of compromise](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/09/compromise_how_.html), I almost felt like I was reading my own work, which, admittedly, sometimes takes on the voice of a grumpy ol' codger or, perhaps, an angry college student. It's not something I'm proud of. Truth is, I'm tolerant of many—if not most—of our imperfections as humans. Of course, laziness and hypocrisy don't make that list, and there are others. Why my personality and rantings —both online and off-line—have taken on a less-tolerant vibe over the past year or so is a mystery to me. But I digress.

The point of this post is to say that Seth explains our own point of view here at Digett when it comes to building websites. This is not to say that we don't build less-than-perfect websites. Undoubtedly we do, almost every time. But we choose the areas in which we must compromise (due to the unfortunate constraints of your important budget) very carefully, and you nor anybody else will have us compromise at all on many points. We won't build a site unless we think it will be effective and unless we can be proud of it.

That's always been true, although our standards have risen, through our experience, such that we look back on some of our earlier efforts with a more modest fondness than we may have at the time. So if you're not serious about making the commitment—financial and otherwise—to producing a winning result, we'll be happy to provide you with a list of some other local folks who will likely be willing to work with you. :-)
