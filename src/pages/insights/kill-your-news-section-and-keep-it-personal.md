As a bit of an old-fashioned scribbler, it almost pains me to write this post. But recent newsworthy events here at Digett and [the ongoing effort to improve our content strategy and publishing](/2010/03/02/four-ways-fix-sub-par-publishing) have led me to the inescapable conclusion that for most businesses, the News Section is boring and harms organizational goals. It's time to kill it.

For the wide-eyed, I mean stop adding content to it and remove it from navigation. Don't remove it from the site; you don't want a rash of missing pages causing site visitors to up sticks and vanish. Just be done with it, put it in a dark corner, and let it gather dust. But before you jump to conclusions, let me clarify a few things:

Don't discontinue your PR activities
------------------------------------

That would be silly. Just stop posting your press releases verbatim to a generic News Section, as there's a good chance nobody's reading them. Press releases are written in [AP style](http://www.apstylebook.com/) and positioned at the media (or they should be, at least), which means they're likely not suitable as web copy. Yes, I know all about web-oriented or SEO releases, but that's more of a search game and doesn't reflect well on content considerations, in my view.

Write your press releases, by all means. Pitch local and national media on coverage for your event/product/super-awesome service. Just stop posting soporific releases about your 0.73% third-quarter revenue gain to your site that are meant for the local business journal.

Post news content on your blog
------------------------------

And no, I'm not contradicting myself. If it's newsworthy, you should publish the content, but rewrite it and reposition it for your blog. We did this recently when we announced [our hiring of Alex Garcia as Senior Web Developer](/2010/03/23/digett-adds-senior-web-developer). Sure, I wrote up a traditional release and sent it to local media, but I changed the copy and made it more personal for publication on our site. This served our purposes in several ways:

*   The information was published.
*   We didn't have to split content between our blog and a News Section.
*   The content now carries the tone and style inherent to Digett.
*   I got to call Alex a snazzy dresserâ€”try getting that in your local paper.

Know your limitations
---------------------

Not every organization is ready for this kind of switch; if you're a very serious company doing very serious business, this may not be for you. There's an argument to be made for humanizing _any_ business, but that's a post for later. If a News Section serves your organization's content strategy and overall goals, so be it.

Likewise, not every company announcement belongs on a blog; despite what so many digital marketers love to think, crisis communications isn't akin to a fireside chat. You don't want to find yourself accused of trivializing a serious situation, so do what you can to plan for the when, where, and how of disseminating bad news.

Disagree with me, by all means
------------------------------

The view from the cheap seats is surprisingly good, so tell me if I'm off base. [We talk fancifully about authenticity](/2008/10/08/authenticity-and-about-us-page), but that can be defined in more than one way. What works best for your organization?
