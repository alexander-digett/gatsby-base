As you read more about digital marketing, one topic you’ll see mentioned often is mobile. Building a company website takes time, and many organizations don’t want to repeat the process with a mobile website. There is, however, an excellent reason to do so.

Your audience is mobile
-----------------------

Your prospective customers are using their phones for more than talking to their families and ordering pizza (although there are apps for that). They’re also checking email, shopping, searching Google, watching videos, and playing games.

When asked what frustrates them most about mobile web browsing, people cite items like poor navigation, hard to find/read information, and slow page load times. These frustrations can be lessened or removed through the use of a specially-crafted mobile website.

The good news
-------------

As the importance of mobile websites increases, so do the number of ways to craft them. A mobile site can often be built in conjunction with a desktop site, making it easier to align the goals of each and keep budgets under control.

Another boon to mobile is the advent of [responsive design](/insights/forget-mobile-go-responsive), which allows a developer to build a single website that dynamically adjusts itself to fit all screens — anything from a large desktop to an iPhone. Mobile visitors can access all of your website’s content with minimum scrolling and zooming, decreasing frustration and giving them a pleasant mobile experience.
