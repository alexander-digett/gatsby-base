All these things describe Alex Garcia, Digett's new Senior Web Developer. That last one is for internal consideration only.

Alex brings 10 years of experience in graphic design and Web application development to the Digett team, so we're pleased as punch to have him here. Just give us a little bit of time to add him to the famous [Digett staff section](/about-us/our-firm).

As our Senior Web Developer, he'll be responsible for directing the firm's development activities, designing, programming, and deploying client sites, and mentoring junior developers. That's a pretty hefty calling, but we have the utmost faith in his abilities; prior to coming here, Alex served ably at KGBTexas and Gray Web Technology, two San Antonio agencies.

I could go on and on about the technical considerations, but there's no need; suffice it to say the guy has development skills that I can barely describe. The part of his resume that interested me was the "Egg Tempera Artist" section. He's won awards, folksâ€”[check out his website](http://www.alexgarciafineart.com/).

That pushes the Digett roster of full-time marketing and web professionals back up to seven; better yet, I've already roped him into blogging for us, and you'll soon see his debut. Ahh, [more audit fodder](/2010/02/23/building-case-content-audit).
