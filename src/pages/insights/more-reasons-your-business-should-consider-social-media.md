How many people really use Facebook? What kind of social media are businesses using?

The [Search Engine Journal](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/the-growth-of-social-media-an-infographic/32788/) has created a great infographic that lays out tons of information in a fun-to-read format.

You can see the rest of the infographic (there's lots more) and download a full PDF version at [their original post](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/the-growth-of-social-media-an-infographic/32788/).

My favorite takeaways:
----------------------

*   Facebook’s user base is _two times_ the population of the United States. That’s a big pool of potential customers to reach out to around the world.
*   75% of Brand “Likes” come from advertisements. Facebook ads tend to cost less than AdWords and offer better demographic targeting. Have you given them a try?
*   Facebook has seen a 200% increase in users accessing the site via mobile. We talk about it all the time, but this is yet another reminder that the number of mobile users on the web is rapidly growing.

*   39% of businesses are blogging. According to [Hubspot](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5014/Study-Shows-Business-Blogging-Leads-to-55-More-Website-Visitors.aspx), businesses that blog get 55% more visitors than companies that don’t. Blogging regularly provides your business with a natural avenue to add new content, including an opportunity to add more keyword-rich copy to your site, great for search engine optmization.

I would never encourage a company to enter the realm of social media or blogging unless they had a plan and a strategy for keeping up with it. That said, many businesses are reaching customers through social media with great success. Are you?
