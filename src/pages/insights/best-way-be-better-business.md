Digett’s weekly team lunch is a great opportunity for us to strengthen team bonds by talking about something other than work, as well as the best way we’ve found to keep everyone in the loop on all projects.

Early in 2014 we decided to take things a step further by including discussions on industry topics. Each week a team member prepares a short, relevant presentation and leads a discussion.

I’ve found this addition instrumental in helping Digett do better business.

What we talk about
------------------

Pretty much anything from optimizing images for Pinterest to [why we love Pantheon](/blog/02/25/2014/why-i-love-pantheon-drupal-hosting) to how to better put ourselves in our clients’ shoes.

Team members find inspiration from webinars and meetings, recent reading and conferences, and each other’s questions.

How this makes us better
------------------------

Even more important than giving us the opportunity to polish our public speaking and presentation skills is the fact that recent presentations have inspired blog posts, upcoming case studies, and an even broader awareness of the digital marketing industry.

It’s amazing how much easier challenging tasks become when you have a team brainstorming solutions with you, and when you take time to listen to another’s presentation or point of view. They might have the solution you need right at their fingertips.

Consistently discovering and discussing new things is the only way to expand our minds; fresh knowledge transfusions means more and better ideas that we can use to do better work for our clients.

I challenge you
---------------

If you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.

Our industry is constantly evolving, and I bet yours is too. Do you give yourself and your team opportunities to discuss these changes together? How might your business improve if you made a habit of sitting down together and talking?

Here’s my challenge: Schedule time for discussion. It doesn’t have to be every week or even every month, but it needs to be routine and consistent.

Meet. Chat. Brainstorm. Be a better business.
