The key to success in any inbound marketing strategy is content generation. One of the goals of content generation is to create subject matter that will get you found by search engines. Here are a couple of ways to make sure your content doesn't fall on deaf ears.

Blog Topical
------------

Being one of the first to blog about a hot topic will most definitely help you rank right at the top of the search results. Don't wait until the market is flooded with relavant content, step up and be one of the first to take a stance.

**Example:** In the past week, my blog post on [parallax scrolling](/insights/custom-web-design-trends-parallax-scrolling) has been the third most visited page on the Digett website, likely because it's topical.

**Example:** In an effort to grab some attention from the Dribbble community, I sketched [this spin](https://dribbble.com/shots/159442-Out-of-Business?list=following) on Osama Bin Laden's death, within an hour of the President's press conference. The shot has been well received, not because it's the best thing I've ever done, but simply because it's topical. Think about how you can turn breaking news into website traffic.

Blog Brief
----------

While on the topic of content generation, we talked the other day in the office about how hard it is to write a short blog post; we concluded that it's because it's much harder to meticulously choose a handful of words that would communicate your topic as clearly as a long-winded essay.

However, these days people just don't have time to read essays, in which case your message isn't communicated at all. For this reason, it may be better in the long run to be meticulous, take the time to choose your words wisely, and be brief.

**Example:** Seth Godin is one of the most famous marketing bloggers on the web and his posts are uber-short. [Check it out.](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/)

When the time is right, a brief, topical blog post can be a sure-fire way to get found online. Don't be afraid to edit down your content and take a stance. The results may surprise you.
