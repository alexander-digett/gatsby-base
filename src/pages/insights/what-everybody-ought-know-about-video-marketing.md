Businesses are no longer restricted by traditional marketing techniques. The world wide web has opened multiple possibilities in marketing, and video marketing is proving to be one of the most effective ones yet. Contrary to popular belief, video marketing is not just simply throwing a few videos on YouTube. It requires work. Thankfully, there are ways you can optimize your video marketing to ensure its full potential.

**The benefits of video marketing**
-----------------------------------

The Internet provides companies with one of the easiest ways to connect with a mass audience. Not only is most of the US population on the Internet, but [in 2012, more than 21 billion videos were watched](http://wpgurus.net/advantages-of-video-marketing/).

Also, [video marketing is effective](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/benefits-video-marketing-infographic/123553?red=st) and can be a low cost marketing tool. You are able to pass on your marketing message through a variety of mediums, providing multiple ways for your target audience to see your content. Video marketing utilizes images and sound, making it easier for the audience to understand the idea and increase their time spent on your page.

With new video apps coming out all the time, the possibilities of video marketing are endless. Applications such as Vine, Snapchat, and Instagram provide businesses with creative and effective ways to reach their audience. These video applications provide a fast and easy way to upload videos.

**Become more search friendly**
-------------------------------

When developing your video marketing, remember it is not simply uploading videos to YouTube or other video platforms. In order to assure full optimization of your videos, it is important you add key information for SEO.

Don’t focus on what is flashy by dressing up your words when attaching keywords and descriptions to your content, but rather what people are more likely to search for. By using [Google’s Adwords Planner](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=adwords&continue=https://adwords.google.com/um/gaiaauth?apt%3DNone%26dst%3D/ko/KeywordPlanner/Home%26dst%3D/ko/KeywordPlanner/Home%26ltmpl%3Djfk&hl=en_US<mpl=jfk&passive=86400&skipvpage=true&sacu=1&sarp=1&sourceid=awo&subid=ww-en-et-awhp_nelsontest_con), you can identify some words for which you would like to rank in your industry. This will make sure your tags and meta descriptions are relevant and search friendly.

### Embedded videos can boost search rankings

To further optimize the search results for your video content, upload your content on multiple platforms. First, upload your video to YouTube and other distribution sites, but alter the title a little for each platform. Then embed the video into your site, thus providing multiple sites where your video can be viewed.

This will ensure you are taking advantage of your SEO, and not restricting its variability. Furthermore, pages with embedded videos can potentially show up higher in search results, allowing your content to stand out more.

**Don’t aim to go viral**
-------------------------

When utilizing video marketing, do not create the content with the mindset of going “viral.” The majority of content that has gone viral did so by accident. Content generally goes viral because it evoked emotions from the user, influencing them to share it.

However, attempting to create content solely for shares and clicks might leave you short handed. Simply fluffing up the title or description of a video to attract viewers can be identified as being phony, thus potentially leaving the company looking desperate and in poor reputation.

By focusing on what your target audience is looking for, you will be able to better create and optimize your video marketing. However, this must connect with content that is sharable and influence clicks. Focus on your message, while forming to your audience’s needs. The content will be relevant and credible, rather than misleading.
