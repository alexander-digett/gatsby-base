It is a truth universally acknowledged that a company that wishes to be successful online needs to have visitors coming to their website. But it’s more than that; driving the _right_ visitors to your site means the difference between doing business and going bust.

Know your customer
------------------

Whether you sell haircuts or Zamboni ice resurfacing machines, you need to understand your audience: their frustrations and desires, favorite publications, methods of communication, preferred language, and even social status.

These [buyer personas](/insights/better-targeting-through-buyer-personas) make it easier to develop and implement a marketing strategy that reaches your company’s ideal customer — without them, you’re playing a guessing game when it comes to creating and promoting content.

How do you know if you’re reaching your best customers when you aren’t sure who makes up that audience?

Guess who
---------

Some business owners are hesitant to focus their efforts on just a handful of ideal customer types — they want to do as much business as possible, and the best way to do that is to market to everyone, right?

Maybe partially right. One of the many beautiful things about humanity is our variety of opinions and personalities. These differences can lead to conflict, but without them we wouldn’t truly be human. These opinions and personalities are shared by your ideal audience.

That being said, nothing your business says or does will please or appeal to everyone — in some cases it may outright infuriate people. Why waste your time and money trying to lure people to your business who will never become customers?

Build it up
-----------

Buyer personas help you gain an understanding of your customers’ behavior, problems, and desires. They operate as the foundation for your [marketing strategy](/insights/why-content-strategy-matters) — what content to create, where to share it, how and when to promote your business, etc.

Without these fundamental building blocks you run the risk of wasting effort and money advertising to the wrong audience.

What can I do?
--------------

If your company already has solid buyer personas developed, great! Keep those foremost in your mind when developing your marketing strategy.

If you’ve never created those personas, or they haven’t been updated in a couple years, you should consider partnering with a marketing agency — they can help you gather the information you need to develop personas and the marketing strategy that will convert prospects into customers.
