Although Black Friday has come and gone, we are still just getting into the holiday shopping season. Don’t wait any longer to pump up your marketing strategy — now is the time to give your customers some holiday cheer. Here are three ways you can improve your marketing this holiday season.

Oh what a sight
---------------

Winter is one of the most beautiful times of the year, so take advantage of it by wowing your customers with gorgeous visuals of the season. Whether you prefer an elegant Christmas tree or a snow covered forest, make sure to use high-quality photos that will catch people’s attention.

If you are ready to take it a step further, try asking your customers to send in photos. What is better than using great visuals made by _real_ customers? Not only will they love being recognized on social media, but incorporating user-generated images can even allow you to run promotions centered around your fans’ content.

Send some cheer
---------------

You would be surprised how many companies actually take the time to send out holiday greetings this time of year. Stand out from your competition by getting a little creative this year with your cards or e-cards.

Want to stand out even more? Send your holiday card on non-traditional card-sending holidays, like New Year’s Eve. You’ll be sure to be the company on your customers’ minds as they go into the new year.

Give a little back
------------------

Since it is the season of giving, why not make a donation to a charitable foundation or volunteer some time for a special cause in place of sending gift baskets to your clients. This is the time to give back to the community, so choose a cause that hits the heart and gets your entire team excited.

And let your clients know about it, too! Include in your next newsletter or holiday card that your company is donating — whether it’s money or time — to a great cause this holiday season. You’d be amazed how far a little “warm and fuzzy” can go. 

Are you ready for the season?
-----------------------------

Preparing your marketing strategy for the holiday season doesn’t have to be daunting. Instead, make it a fun and creative time the whole office can get in on.
