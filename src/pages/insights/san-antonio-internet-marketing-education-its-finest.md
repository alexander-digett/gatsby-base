 San Antonio business owners and marketing execs got a good dose of Internet marketing education Tuesday, thanks to the North San Antonio Chamber’s How2 Series event entitled "How to Market Your Business" at the Hilton San Antonio Airport. I want to extend my personal thanks to all who attended, and especially to those who approached me after my presentations on lead generation and email nurturing to offer a compliment or word of appreciation. That made my week! Unfortunately, in my excitement I forgot to put up my last slide offering a few freebies that might help inspire some further action on your part. So without further ado, here are the links:

San Antonio business owners and marketing execs got a good dose of Internet marketing education Tuesday, thanks to the [North San Antonio Chamber](https://www.northsachamber.com/)’s How2 Series event entitled “How to Market Your Business” at the Hilton San Antonio Airport.

I want to extend my personal thanks to all who attended, and especially to those who approached me after my presentations on lead generation and email nurturing to offer a compliment or word of appreciation. That made my week!

Unfortunately, in my excitement I forgot to put up my last slide offering a few freebies that might help inspire some further action on your part. So without further ado, here are the links:

*   [My presentation](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fprezi.com%2Ft41q5yvsmn4z%2Faugust-30-north-sa-chamber-how-to-series%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHirXVH-tlNswUMutoiuHz6aWkakw) - This was created with Prezi, a totally rad new tool that I think I’m falling in love with. I wish you would take a moment to leave a comment to tell me whether you liked the format of it. If you prefer the more traditional, static powerpoint slides, you may not be alone and I may need to reconsider my approach.  
     
*   [Inbound marketing mindmap](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mindmeister.com%2F108546465%2Fpillars-of-inbound-marketing&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNErwBMeboMWzIvDAtjYpE72i-DvHw) - This mindmap is something I began creating about a year ago, and forms the core of not only Tuesday’s presentation, but also just about every conversation I have on the topic. Meet MindMeister, a really sublime hosted mindmapping application. I could scarcely live without it.  
     
*   [Scorecard template](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fa%2Fdigett.com%2Fspreadsheet%2Fpub%3Fhl%3Den_US%26hl%3Den_US%26key%3D0AnDRxZqDMmk0dERISGhyRXpHbldXRE9uOGg5STduSnc%26output%3Dhtml) - This is a spreadsheet we keep in Google Docs that we maintain for many of our clients to be able to track lead generation progress at a glance. You can modify this in any manner you want. The idea is to give you an idea of some relevant metrics to consider as you’re getting started.

Oh, and please don’t forget about [Digett’s upcoming webinar on social media](http://webinar), Tuesday, September 13!
