Okay, so if you don't want to listen to Digett tell you how awesome Hubspot is, then maybe hearing [Google and Salesforce.com sing their praises](http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/42537/Insights-On-SaaS-From-The-32-million-HubSpot-Mega-VC-Round.aspx) will get your attention. Today [Hubspot announced a new $32 million round of financing](http://www.hubspot.com/blog/bid/10491/Sequoia-Google-Ventures-and-Salesforce-com-Invest-32-Million-in-HubSpot) by the two giants of SaaS (software as a service), along with Sequoia Capital.

The takeaway? From our perspective it's a home run for us personally, because:

1.  It serves to validate the message that inbound marketing is an immensely profitable industry;
2.  It shines a very bright spotlight on one of the leading inbound marketing platforms, which happens to be the one we've partnered with; and
3.  It gives me the same "whatever we touch turns to gold" feeling I get when I consider that Digett was also an early adopter of the Drupal content management system. 

This is a big win for inbound marketing, for Hubspot, as well as for Digett and other Hubspot VARs. Oh, and since we are also a Salesforce.com customer, we're excited about what this partnership could mean for the future of integration of the two products (which is already pretty impressive).
