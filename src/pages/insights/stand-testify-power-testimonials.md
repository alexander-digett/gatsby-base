When I think of testimonials, I am taken back to childhood memories of church services. Once in awhile someone in the congregation would stand up and “testify”: they had experienced something profound and wanted to share it.

Testimonials are a way for your customers to demonstrate appreciation and affirm your business’ value and worth. They make you feel good, but the true beauty is that they can make potential customers feel good about you, too!

Your Pulpit
-----------

[86% of consumers do research online](http://www.inc.com/news/articles/201102/half-of-consumers-combine-search-and-social-media-for-help-buying.html) before making a purchase. There is a lot of information available, and what existing customers say about a company carries a great deal of influence.

Companies that share testimonials demonstrate two things:

1.  They provide the products and services consumers are looking for.
2.  They do it with such professionalism, expertise, and customer service that their customers are happy to share their experience and recommend the company to others.

The Promised Land
-----------------

Testimonials provide consumers with comfort as they explore new opportunities and take their first step toward engaging with your company. Testimonials are proof that people trust you to provide exactly what you promise.

Consumers are just as happy to write negative testimonials (affectionately called “complaints”) when you fail to deliver on your promises. We’ve talked before about [the power of your brand](/blog/10/11/2012/it-s-not-strategy-until-you-brand-it) and the importance of [your online reputation](/blog/10/09/2012/dig-your-own-grave-paid-reviews); you can’t take the absentee approach when negative circumstances arise. This is your chance to be responsive, right a customer wrong, and capitalize on the opportunity by sharing it with your audience.

Are You There?
--------------

It’s imperative that you listen to your customers. Sure there is both good and bad, but listen. Promote what they identify you do well; take criticism to heart and do your best to resolve any issues.

Do these things often and well, and you may soon have enough happy customers to start converting those testimonials into something greater: case studies. These can be powerful resources for you, but you have to start somewhere.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Insights, customer reviews, feedback, testimonials — no matter what you call them, these thoughts and feedback can build trust, two-way communication, and give you a crystal-clear idea of what your customers think and want.

Don’t be afraid to ask for them, engage with customers about them, and promote positive outcomes and experiences.

Amen!
