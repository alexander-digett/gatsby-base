 On Monday we noticed that the atomic clock on the wall in our reception area was off one hour; a victim, no doubt, of the bizarre change in when we implement daylight savings time in this country. No sweat. I just pushed the "ET", or "eastern time", button, and fooled it into showing the correct time. Okay, so I'm reaching for something interesting here.

On Monday we noticed that the atomic clock on the wall in our reception area was off one hour; a victim, no doubt, of the bizarre change in when we implement daylight savings time in this country. No sweat. I just pushed the "ET", or "eastern time", button, and fooled it into showing the correct time. Okay, so I'm reaching for something interesting here. But give me a break, it's been a hard couple of months.
