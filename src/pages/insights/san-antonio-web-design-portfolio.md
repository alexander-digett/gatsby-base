Notice anything different about our main navigation? That's right, a new design section! We've recently added an abbreviated portfolio to our website, meant to show off our mad design skills, and link to our best work.

![form-follows-function.png](/assets/form-follows-function.png)We launched the new Digett.com back in January, without a design portfolio because we didn't want to detract from our [inbound marketing](/digital-marketing-solutions) message. Although we do provide the best in San Antonio web design, from our perspective, websites should be lead generators before anything else. Form should follow function.

Web Design Matters
------------------

We realized soon enough that our designs were more important than we initially thought. Potential clients began to ask to see our work, in order to feel more comfortable with the Digett brand. They wanted to be sure we could provide professional-quality design in addition to an effective inbound marketing strategy â€” the best of both worlds.

![good-design.png](/assets/good-design.png)We've found over the past few months that good design can not only start a conversation, but also close a deal. And so we decided to put some of our best work on display.

So take a look through our new portfolio page and imagine your new website next to these. It could be our greatest yet, and the key to growing your business.
