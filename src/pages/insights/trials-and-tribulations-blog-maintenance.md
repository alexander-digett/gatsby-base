 One of the more challenging aspects of content governance is maintaining a blog, particularly if it's well-established and contains years worth of posts. Trust me on this one; as part of my role as guardian of Digett's content, I've been auditing and maintaining a half-decade's worth of blog posts from more than 10 authors. Invariably, the emotional response to this activity tends to range from: Wow, that post was insightful, straightforward, and written in something approximating proper English. Sweet Caroline, what were we thinking?!?

One of the more challenging aspects of [content governance](/2010/04/01/content-governance-common-concern "content governance") is maintaining a blog, particularly if it's well-established and contains years worth of posts. Trust me on this one; as part of my role as guardian of Digett's content, I've been auditing and maintaining a half-decade's worth of blog posts from more than 10 authors. Invariably, the emotional response to this activity tends to range from:

*   Wow, that post was insightful, straightforward, and written in [something approximating proper English](/2009/02/10/speak-queens-english "something approximating proper English").
*   Sweet Caroline, what were we thinking?!?

It's in the latter situations that I find the ROT (Redundant, Outdated, Trivial) or OUCH (Outdated, Unnecessary, Correct, Have to write) content scoring techniques only do so much. After all, you still have to _do_ something about troubled content. Unfortunately, there are a couple of potentially sticky blog governance situations that have me scratching my noodle:

Updating incorrect, outdate, or unneeded posts
----------------------------------------------

From what I've seen, the content community is still split on whether old blog posts should be subject to edit or should just stand untouched. Frankly, I see the pros and cons of both positions. On one hand, you don't want incorrect or grossly outdated posts polluting your positioning; on the other, you don't want to look like you're trying to mislead or rewrite history. You also face SEO and taxonomy considerations.

But when it comes down to it, I can't help but think that rewriting a blog post is a blow to authenticity. Instead, my suggestion is to _append_ updated or corrected information. If you were wrong, admit it; if times have rendered a previous tactic or opinion useless, let people know. You'll likely gain more from your honesty than you would from just taking a big, pink eraser to your content.

However, I'm still confounded by [posts like this](/2009/03/17/our-phones-are-down "posts like this"). To me, removing it is a zero-sum game—but I haven't pulled the trigger, obviously. What's stopping me?

Dealing with an ex-employee's blog
----------------------------------

We had an employee leave recently, so I've been forced to wonder what should be done—if anything—about his blog posts. I'm not concerned about ownership issues or propriety; rather, I wonder if there might be any perceived loss of knowledge or depth from the Digett team. Besides, having one blog post after another from former staffers is akin to hosting a virtual morgue.

Still, some of those old posts are remarkably popular and well-indexed, and serving up redirects to visitors looking for very specific content isn't a wise idea. Plus, they serve as that all-important record of achievement that helps establish us as subject-matter experts, even if the author no longer works here. Ultimately, I score this as an awkward situation caused by our commitment to being open about [who we are](/about-us/our-firm).

Controlling exploding taxonomy
------------------------------

At present, we have 19 terms that categorize our blog posts—though only 5-6 are used on a regular basis. That's neither here nor there, and I'm certainly not trying to ignite a debate in the Drupal community about the proper incubation and use of taxonomy terms.

I'm just looking at this from a user experience standpoint. For one, being faced with so many taxonomy terms is confusing and causes hesitation, even doubt, when navigating a site. Moreover, seeing content weighted toward a few items in the midst of a wide-ranging taxonomy tends to make me think we might appear impulsive or unfocused in our publishing efforts. However, there can be drawbacks to removing taxonomy terms, though I can't cover them all here.

I imagine I'll be dealing with these three issues for a while; technologies/techniques change, as does our firm, and I just don't see myself posting to the Wine and Dine category. I don't want y'all knowing what I eat.
