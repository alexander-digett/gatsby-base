A major component to search engine optimization (SEO) is choosing the right keywords around which to develop your content strategy. A _keyword_ is a word or phrase that your customer might enter into a search engine (ex. Google) to find your company and others like it.

For example, if I were looking for someone to optimize my website in San Antonio, I might Google _San Antonio SEO_. Now, a company that wants to be at the top of those search results would need to publish compelling online content, optimized for that keyword — _San Antonio SEO —_  
in order to rank high in search engine results.

Choosing the right keywords takes time and research, much like planting a garden. To yield the best results, you've got to understand your climate, soil, and sunlight, among other key factors.
