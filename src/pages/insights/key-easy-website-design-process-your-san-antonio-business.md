If you’ve been a San Antonio resident for any length of time, you’ve seen the commercials for the local car dealership with the one simple price promise. You know you want a car, you walk on the lot, look at the prices and decide whether to buy. Why can’t getting a new website design in San Antonio be so easy?

If you’ve started the search for a new web design or web development effort or if you’re about to start, how can you make the process easier? Consider the following to empower yourself as a consumer/decision-maker and to ensure you end up with a strong final product.

Ask yourself the right questions
--------------------------------

Occasionally, I’ll talk to someone who will say, “I want a website. How much does it cost?” There’s not a business out there that’s not budget-conscious and there is nothing illegitimate about that question. I understand that question and we’re always dedicated to working with that person to get them the information they need.

That said, that question is like telling a seamstress, “I want a new dress. How much will it cost?”

*   What style of dress is it?
*   What kind of event is it for?
*   What should people think when they see it?
*   What kind of fabric will be used?
*   How hard is that fabric to work with?
*   Is there lace or beading? Other embellishments?
*   Does it need a zipper?
*   Should it match any accessories?

Like a handmade dress, a quality website is customized to your business and its needs and there can be a lot of questions to answer.

That’s the main difference between buying a car and buying a website. A car is effective if it can transport you from Point A to Point B. The effectiveness of a new website can vary vastly from business to business. That variation makes it difficult to talk about costs without some conversation first.

### You know you want a new website, but more importantly, you want a _successful_ website

You can make a new website design effort easier on yourself and more successful overall if you’re able to discuss what will make your site effective. What should this site _do_ for your business? Six months after launch, what does this site need to achieve to be considered successful? (Our suggestion would be that a website should, above all else, bring you more business.)

Price is important, but so is ROI. Find a web firm that gives the right answers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you contact a web firm, be prepared to share what you envision. Any web firm can give you a website for X price, but you want a website for X price that also _works for you_. Price is important, obviously, but so is making sure your investment will achieve its goals.

A good web design firm will listen to you, advise you, and be interested in helping you see results, hopefully, within a budget that works for you.

There’s no one simple price, San Antonio, for a quality website. Help a firm understand your expectations for a new website and they’ll be better equipped to set expectations in terms of price. By discussing your goals up front, you can make sure you’re teaming up with a firm that will help bring you results for a price that makes sense.
