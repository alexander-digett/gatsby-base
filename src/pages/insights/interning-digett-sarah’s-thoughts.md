Well, the time has come. [My internship at Digett](/blog/06/04/2013/digett-brings-summer-marketing-intern) has ended, and the new school year is fast approaching. As I reflect back on my time spent here, I know I have learned and achieved many valuable things during the past two and a half months.

The work
--------

During my internship, I completed a variety of different projects.

*   Polished up my copywriting and editing skills as I wrote and reviewed blog articles
*   Helped put together a case study for a client
*   Built an email newsletter
*   Further boosted my Photoshop skills designing promotional materials such as an event flyer

Other major accomplishments included completing Hubspot’s Inbound Marketing Certification course, and partnering with a local nonprofit organization to revamp their social media efforts.

To top it off, I worked with the team to plan and grow their internship program going into the future and helped secure a team of interns for the fall semester. 

I learned a lot about industry best practices that I haven’t learned as much about in school — such as SEO tips, the importance of corporate blogging and social media, and more — and compiled many new resources and blogs that I can use to further my knowledge in the future.

Beyond the concrete
-------------------

Although I learned different skills from each new project, I also benefitted from my internship in ways that go beyond simply completing the tasks themselves. I was able to glimpse into the inner workings of an actual company, and what their daily work is like as they create value for their clients.

The Digett team was very focused on assisting me with my professional development and helping me grow. During my internship I took a strengths finder test to learn more about my own skills, and was able to spend time developing [my LinkedIn page](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sarah-van-dyke/60/b72/913) (I’d love to connect with you there!).

I saw just how valuable collaboration can be in a work environment as I watched the team work together to improve upon each other’s ideas and help them grow into fully developed projects.

In school I am accustomed to having an assignment, completing it, receiving a grade, and moving on. I learned that in the real world, projects are a back and forth process of refining rather than a one-time grade — which can result in a better finished product than one person could have come up with on their own.

Saying goodbye
--------------

Overall, this summer allowed me to earn invaluable experience and to get to work with a great group of people. I wish the next round of fall semester interns good luck as they begin their adventures, and I am so glad to have been a part of the Digett team!
