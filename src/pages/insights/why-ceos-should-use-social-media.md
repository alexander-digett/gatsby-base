Many CEOs are hesitant to use social media, citing fears of negative feedback, bad handling of crises, and lack of measurable and healthy return on investment. But as social media becomes ubiquitous and younger CEOs who grew up using it bring that expertise to their own businesses, knowing and leveraging social media’s value has become crucial.

Business benefits
-----------------

Mashable’s [The Future Social CEO](http://4.mshcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/02_FutureSocialCEO.png) infographic has lots of info on the CEO of the future, but it also includes some current statistics that may surprise you:

*   45% of businesses have reduced their marketing expenses using social media.
*   48% have generated more qualified leads using social media.
*   35% of those businesses have used social media to close business deals.

Gain consumers’ trust
---------------------

The [2012 CEO, Social Media & Leadership Survey](http://www.brandfog.com/CEOSocialMediaSurvey/BRANDfog_2012_CEO_Survey.pdf) revealed that 82% of respondents are more likely to trust a company whose CEO and leadership steam openly communicate via social media. Also, 77% of respondents are more likely to _buy_ from brands whose CEO and/or leadership team uses social media to communicate.

Humanize your company
---------------------

The Madmen days of high-rise offices and dry, useless press releases are over. It’s time to start interacting with customers on their turf, and be willing to give a little to get something in return. Ask questions, give away gifts (no strings attached), and focus on your audience instead of your business.

Lead the way
------------

As a CEO, part of your job is to be a visionary. You are the leader of your company; how can you expect your employees to innovate or be “authentic” or “engaged” with your customers if you’re dragging your feet?

It’s trite but true: great leaders lead by example, and attitude reflects leadership. What kind of leader are you?
