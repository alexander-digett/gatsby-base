When the folks at the Brazos County Exposition Complex approached Digett in search of new website, we had a number of ideas about how to best showcase their state-of-the-art facilities. A $20 million county venture on 150 acres in Bryan-College Station, Texas, the Expo Complex consists of three facilities capable of hosting a wide range of event types from rodeos to horse and livestock shows, trade shows, and wedding receptions. With the new [BrazosCountyExpo.com](http://brazoscountyexpo.com/), we are making it easy for those attending or booking events to find all the information they need.

### Accessible and Detailed Information for Each Venue  

The Arena, Pavilion, and Exhibit Hall have the equipment and technology to accommodate a large range of needs. But how does an interested party know which venue is right for them?

We leveraged a majority of the home page real estate to spotlight the strengths of each building to help one decide. The typical scheduler for a rodeo is looking for very different information than someone wanting to host a banquet, and we wanted to clarify and simplify the process of discovering which venue works for them.

A single click from the home page will navigate the user to a more in-depth rundown of features, as well as photography of previous events hosted at the Expo Complex. There's also a link to each venue accessible from every page of the site, so visitors always can easily get to the information they need.

### Welcoming Design  

While the Expo Complex is home to a lot of [equestrian events](http://www.brazoscountyexpo.com/facility/arena) and [livestock shows](http://www.brazoscountyexpo.com/facility/pavilion), it also hosts upscale [receptions,](http://www.brazoscountyexpo.com/facility/exhibit-hall) career fairs, and monster truck shows. The Expo Complex wanted to avoid the perception that they only host "Western" events, so we stuck to a modern color palette and a fresh feel to keep the site welcoming to all types of event interests.

### Easy Interactivity  

Interested in booking? Need to know more? We've kept a link to the inquiry form handy on the home page and on every venue page to quickly shoot the Expo Complex an email.

### See What's Going on at a Glance  

The Expo Complex's events are displayed in two waysâ€”a short list on the home page for a fast look at upcoming events and a comprehensive calendar inside. The calendar serves as a useful resource for audiences interested in booking, as well as those attending events at the Expo Complex or simply looking for something interesting to do around town.

By utilizing a friendly design and making it easy to find information, we've created a successful website that will address every audience's needs.
