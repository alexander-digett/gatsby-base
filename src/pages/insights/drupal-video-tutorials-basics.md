 We love using Drupal at Digett because it’s open source, flexible, and has a great community built around it. But as someone who came into web marketing with no knowledge of Drupal, I can understand our clients’ occasional frustration at not being able to immediately take charge of their website and make the updates and changes they want.

We love using Drupal at Digett because it’s open source, flexible, and has a great community built around it. But as someone who came into web marketing with no knowledge of Drupal, I can understand our clients’ occasional frustration at not being able to immediately take charge of their website and make the updates and changes they want.

It is with this in mind that Digett has created a series of Drupal content management video tutorials. This series covers the most common content management actions in Drupal, and is intended to help Drupal beginners in the management of their websites.

Things to keep in mind
----------------------

*   These tutorials were developed with Drupal 6 websites in mind, although many elements may also apply to earlier and later versions of Drupal.
*   While many Drupal websites function in similar ways, no two sites are exactly alike: some functions described in these tutorials may not be available on your website, your user account may not have the appropriate permissions, or the processes may look just a bit different.
*   These tutorials are available publicly, both in these blog articles and on [Digett’s YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/digettvideo). If you are a Drupal developer or firm, please feel free to share these tutorials with your clients.

First, the basics
-----------------

These tutorials cover the most basic aspects of content management on a Drupal website.

*   How to Log In
*   How to Edit a Page
*   How to Create a Page
*   See All Content
*   Removing Content
*   How to Log Out

### Here’s a first taste:

And stay tuned

In the coming weeks we’ll be showcasing our series on using the text editor, as well as some more slightly advanced content management tasks.
