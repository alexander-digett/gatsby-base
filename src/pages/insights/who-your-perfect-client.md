summary: > 
 As the Marketing Strategist and Business Development guy for Digett, one part of my job is to bring on new clients — a task that requires answering as many questions as I ask. One I’m asked quite often is, "Who is your perfect client?" I love this question because I can immediately tell that the person sitting across from me gets it. They really want to understand my business so they can help.
