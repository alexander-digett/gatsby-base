 I recently was asked by a client to provide some ammunition for selling Drupal to his management team. I found plenty info using my friend Google, but ultimately had to spend an hour or so organizing it into a concise list of bullet points that I thought addressed the broad spectrum of benefits that Drupal can provide.  I thought I'd share with others who may need something similar at some point.

I recently was asked by a client to provide some ammunition for selling Drupal to his management team. I found plenty info using my friend Google, but ultimately had to spend an hour or so organizing it into a concise list of bullet points that I thought addressed the broad spectrum of benefits that Drupal can provide.  I thought I'd share with others who may need something similar at some point.

Without further ado...

**First, it's Open Source:**

*   Supported by a large developer community
*   No proprietary licensing fees
*   Long-term ROI not tied to performance of a single vendor firm
*   Portable
*   Transparent security focus
*   Advantages over a custom-built system:
    *   Resources required to match quality of Drupal code would be enormous
    *   Hardened by years of widespread use and developer contributions
    *   Extremely secure

**The Drupal Advantage**

*   Most popular and most powerful open-source CMS
    *   huge install base
    *   massive, active development community

*   Drupal is a CMS and an effective application framework
    *   clean, extensible code base
    *   many high-quality modules available for add-on capability
    *   keep custom, proprietary code to a minimum
    *   build highly functional custom modules to accomplish practically any task

*   High performance
    *   built-in caching
    *   integrates easily with 3rd party caching mechanisms
    *   infinitely scalable

*   SEO friendly right out of the box
    *   standards-compliant HTML/CSS
    *   capable of custom (HTML) page titles, meta descriptions
    *   customizable, friendly URLs
    *   permalinks
    *   simple Google Analytics integration (without writing or inserting code)

*   Extremely well documented
*   Mature, going into seventh major release
*   Flexible, powerful theming engine separates content completely from presentation; a Drupal site's look-and-feel is limited only to the constraints of imagination and the modern web browser.
*   Easy to install and support, runs on Windows or practically any AMP (Apache, mySQL, PHP) stack
*   Notable Drupal Features and Selling Points
    *   Powerful taxonomy system for categorizing content
    *   User registration and profiles
    *   Role-based permission system
    *   Out-of-box RSS feeds
    *   Browser-based administration
