Join us for a day filled with Drupal Theming in Austin on Friday, June 22. This is a one-day class aimed at helping you master the most fundamental activity involved with effectively leveraging Drupal's value as a CMS: Theming Drupal. From every angle.

This workshop is ideal for the beginner to intermediate level, and will provide everything possible to bring you up to speed on the most fundamental element in leveraging Drupal to create a powerful, attractive solution for your clients. Planned sessions include theming basics, building a theme from the ground up, and theming [Views](http://drupal.org/project/views) and [CCK](http://drupal.org/project/cck).

We'll rely largely on Roger's in-depth understanding and mastery of Drupal's architecture, his passion to explore the limits of Drupal theming, and his ability to clearly explain complex subjects clearly and succinctly. Roger Lopez has been the brains behind our innovative work with Churchill Downs and Arizona State University, and specifically our approach to solving their problems using Drupal.

Additionally we'll enlist Colin to help connect with designers in the audience who want to become one of that rare breed who comfortably and competently meets the challenges both of effective visual design and coding. As an added treat, we're considering a brief 4-person panel to include Digett's creative director, Trevor Dodd (speaker at the most recent Flash Forward conference in Austin) and company president Mark Figart, to round out the day. Might be cool to talk a little about Digett's experience in turning opportunities for implementing Drupal into a profitable venture... from sale through delivery.

We hope to see you at our way cool venue, The Parish Room!
