summary: > 
 As a client or potential client of Digett you probably have taken a look through our blog posts and wondered why we bother posting technical articles about Drupal. Some people think, "That’s not what a client wants to read." or “Prospects aren’t interested in all that technobabble.”  But as a client—ours or anyone else’s—the technical materials should be important to you too. Here’s why and what you can learn from our example.

As a client or potential client of Digett you probably have taken a look through our blog posts and wondered why we bother posting technical articles about Drupal. Some people think, “That’s not what a client wants to read.” or “Prospects aren’t interested in all that technobabble.”  But as a client—ours or anyone else’s—the technical materials should be important to you too. Here’s why and what you can learn from our example.

Actions Speak Louder
--------------------

Too many times have I been on a website and seen Joomla, Wordpress, Drupal, and Dreamweaver all listed as the expertise of a small firm. Anyone can list off all the top content management systems (CMS) and claim to be an expert, but the more likely scenario is that they are proficient at one or maybe two and passable at the others.  

So how can you tell if someone really knows Drupal (or any other platform)? Read their technical posts and the comments. Are the posts educational and do they talk about applying technical knowledge on the topic? Do they have comments and are they from other developers? Do the comments support the notion that the author is an expert on the topic?  You don’t have to completely understand all of the technical language to get a sense of whether the author knows what he or she is doing.

Enthusiasm is Contagious
------------------------

A large part of the purpose of any website is to attract traffic and build a community. Talking about things that interest you is a way to do both. The interesting thing about being interesting is that when one tries to be interesting they often fail, but when one gets excited about something others get excited too. Evangelist John Wesley, famously said, “Catch on fire with enthusiasm and people will come for miles to watch you burn.” You don’t have to be the most polished writer to talk about what interests you — just “catch on fire with enthusiasm.”

Our technical posts about Drupal have brought in a substantial increase in overall traffic to our site. And while much of that traffic is from other developers and not prospects, the traffic increase has a positive effect on our credibility with search engines.

Drupal is the Bomb
------------------

Lastly, Drupal is on an upward trend in popularity and awareness, and has been for a few years. There are some large Drupal firms with sales efforts out talking about Drupal among enterprise clients. While we didn’t choose Drupal for this reason, we are positioned to ride this wave of growth due to our established expertise in Drupal and experience with building visually appealing, clean and user friendly sites.

So Drupal is not only what we are enthusiastic about, but it is a positively trending topic in web design. We blog about Drupal so much because it brings together both of those reasons while providing evidence to prospects of our technical expertise.
