 My name is Andrew and I confess, I have never blogged. I might be the only person in the office to have never blogged before now. You can understand that I feel a certain amount of pressure to do a good job, though I doubt there's a standard by which blog posts are measured.

My name is Andrew and I confess, I have never blogged. I might be the only person in the office to have never blogged before now. You can understand that I feel a certain amount of pressure to do a good job, though I doubt there's a standard by which blog posts are measured. I used to play golf with a guy who, before every shot, would say, "Here's hoping." So in that same spirit of not knowing where this is going, here's hoping.

About three weeks ago our resident computer whisperer, Roger, came to me with a challenge, to submit an entry to the 2008 Drupalcon Logo Contest. Drupalcon, he explained, is a conference held twice a year for companies and individuals like us to get together and learn about what is new in the world of Drupal, the content management system Digett uses. This year, a couple of our team members will attend the conference in Boston, MA.

Every conference needs a T-shirt and every T-shirt needs a logo, common knowledge, yes? Enter the 2008 Drupalcon Logo Contest. Requirements concentrate on the logo working well on a black, white and colored background. So my toolbox included a set of colors, Drupalcon 2008 and the city of Boston.

I think what I've come up with is simple and says what it needs to at a glance, which is what a logo should do. Its simplicity and versatility is what sets it apart from the others. It has an advantage, I feel.

Check it out if you have the time [here](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/node/345). The judges will take into consideration voting from the public. I would tell you to vote for my logo, but in the interest of fairness I ask that you look through all the designs first and then vote for my logo. And keep an eye out for another logo entry I have in the works, it should be unveiled in the near future, I'll keep you posted.
