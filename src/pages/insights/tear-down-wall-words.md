 Often I have a client who needs a lot of words on the page. At first glance, I feel like I can condense the message — but just as often, the nature of my client's industry requires specific language. Good design and marketing practices tell me to have a short page to read, but when I try to edit the page, there isn't much content I can trim (especially when there are product features or legally-required points to cover).

Often I have a client who needs a lot of words on the page. At first glance, I feel like I can condense the message — but just as often, the nature of my client's industry requires specific language. Good design and marketing practices tell me to have a short page to read, but when I try to edit the page, there isn't much content I can trim (especially when there are product features or legally-required points to cover).

We are busy, we want short sentences, we want people to get to the point — how do you keep it short when you have a lot of information to share?

Step 1: Trim what you can
-------------------------

There is always some trimming possible. Here are a few ideas:

*   [Change passive to active voice](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/active-voice-versus-passive-voice). This makes the content more engaging and easier to read and many times it eliminates some extra words.
*   Remove unneeded [prepositional phrases](http://grammarist.com/grammar/prepositional-phrases/).
*   Replace big words with small ones.
*   Throw out entire sentences if they repeat something already said, or if they do not logically flow from the previous sentence.

Step 2: Graphics can replace words
----------------------------------

Are there concepts or features that can be better illustrated instead of described? If a picture is worth a thousand words, let's get more pictures and remove those thousand words.

Step 3: Advanced design
-----------------------

Are there user interface tweaks that can break down the content into manageable chunks? If I go to a web page and there is a wall of words, I run [screaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb8t25ePTlg); but if I go to a web page and see fewer words, I'll examine it. Take for example a website from a company named Panic; they have a lot of features to list for [their product Coda](http://www.panic.com/coda/), so they have broken down the wall of words into a nice series of horizontal sliding panels with icons and graphics to create visual interest. 

Bottom line
-----------

The key here is interest. The page needs to be interesting. The wall of words may be wonderful words that I may take the time to read if it were on paper, but on the screen, the mindset is different. Most of the time, the reader is busy and task-driven. They want the information they are seeking. My rule of thumb? Imagine holding a cute crying baby in your arms while you read the page you are editing. There is a lot of noise in our culture, a lot of competing priorities going on inside your reader's head. Can your message be scanned, can you message be "heard" over that crying baby?
