Authentic Custom Homes is one of the Hill Country’s best-known custom home builders. Whether you need a comfy bungalow or a sprawling mansion, Authentic Custom Homes can take you from original brainstorming to your fully-furnished custom dream home — on time and on budget.

Authentic Custom Homes came to Digett with two main requirements for their new website:

*   Clearly elucidate what makes Authentic Custom Homes different from their competitors
*   Beautifully showcase the company’s impressive custom homes portfolio

The new [ACHomes.com](http://www.achomes.com/) meets these goals, and also gives Authentic Custom Homes a solid foundation for blogging and SEO (search engine optimization) improvements.

Giving potential clients what they want
---------------------------------------

Digett’s market research indicated that individuals interested in building a high-end custom home are all about details: they want to know in which geographic locations a builder will build, what home styles they design, and what the build process and finished products look like, etc.

We reorganized Authentic Custom Homes’ website structure to make it easier for potential clients to get the details they need. The homepage showcases Authentic Custom Homes’ differentiators and designs at a high level, and the primary navigation makes it easy for visitors to access whatever information is most important to them.

A strong visual focus
---------------------

As the saying goes, the proof is in the pudding, and people interested in building a custom home want to see builders’ previous work.

The Authentic Custom Homes site features almost 20 galleries, each dedicated to a specific home or feature. The photos are easily enlarged and skimmed through, making the user experience smooth and friendly.

Just the tip of the iceberg
---------------------------

The new Authentic Custom Homes website looks great and makes it easy for visitors to find what they seek, but it’s even more impressive under the hood.

The site is built on WordPress, one of the most popular and secure content management systems, and is structured from the ground up with search engine optimization (SEO) in mind.

Digett also created a content marketing strategy (including blogging, social media engagement, and pay-per-click advertising) that will support Authentic Custom Homes’ lead generation plan. We’re looking forward to working together to bring them great success in 2014 and beyond!
