Hunting is a statewide pastime in Texas, and there are plenty of hunting ranches from which to choose. Sonora Trophy Hunts wanted a website that showcased their game, amenities, and expertise in creating personalized one-on-one guided hunts for their guests.

**Update: After more than a year working with Sonora Trophy Hunts, we're sad to see them go. We enjoyed working with their team at the ranch, and wish them the best of luck going forward. **

We set several goals for the first phase of Sonora Trophy Hunts' online marketing effort:

*   Develop a brand strategy and messaging platform on which to base STH’s online and offline activity (website, blogging, community engagement, etc.)
*   Design and build a website that emphasizes guides’ expertise and staff’s commitment to a personalized hunting experience for each guest
*   Establish the foundation for lead generation
*   Ongoing content strategy and community building/engagement

Brand strategy
--------------

Although Sonora Trophy Hunts has been in operation since 2004, they knew it was time for an update. Along with modernizing their logo, we collaborated extensively on a brand and segmentation strategy that helped us all focus on and cater to specific audiences.

This work involved research, tours of the ranch, multiple phone conferences, and dozens of documents, and has guided our mutual teams toward strategic decisions that benefit Sonora Trophy Hunts and their guests.

Website build
-------------

Using what we learned during strategy development—and using the Drupal CMS as a foundation—we were able to create a flexible website that integrates with both Flickr (for displaying dozens of photos in multiple galleries) and Campaign Monitor (list building, segmentation, and automated marketing).

Ongoing lead generation
-----------------------

A combination of hunting season-centered content creation, social media activity, and ongoing marketing campaigns forms the backbone of our lead generation strategy. This part of the process will change and grow over time, and we can’t wait to see where it takes us.
