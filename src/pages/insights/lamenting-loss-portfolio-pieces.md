 In case you haven't noticed—and judging by the attendance, you haven't*—we made a few changes the other day over at our portfolio. We're not talking major renovations; I simply added three items and removed two. However, the experience left me with a touch of melancholy.  The two items I cut from the list—the Boerne CVB and the Cibolo Nature Center—were jobs performed for local clients with whom we've had long-standing relationships. Those relationships aren't in jeopardy, incidentally. For one, we simply wanted to show off some of our recent work; additionally, one of those websites was built on a platform we no longer use or emphasize.

In case you haven't noticed—and judging by the attendance, you haven't\*—we made a few changes the other day over at our [portfolio](/our-work "portfolio"). We're not talking major renovations; I simply added three items and removed two. However, the experience left me with a touch of melancholy.

The two items I cut from the list—the [Boerne CVB](http://www.visitboerne.org "Boerne CVB") and the [Cibolo Nature Center](http://www.cibolo.org/ "Cibolo Nature Center")—were jobs performed for local clients with whom we've had long-standing relationships. Those relationships aren't in jeopardy, incidentally. For one, we simply wanted to show off some of our recent work; additionally, one of those websites was built on a platform we no longer use or emphasize.

Part of me should rejoice in having to remove those two sites, as it means (1) we've been around a while and (2) we've grown up. That said, looking back is, in many cases, a useful exercise before moving forward. Having done so [in the course of our content audit](/2010/02/23/building-case-content-audit "in the course of our content audit") and in simply being here for almost two years, a few things have struck me.

We are indebted, and committed, to our community
------------------------------------------------

Since our 2001 founding, Digett has taken an active role in the Boerne community whenever possible. Indeed, the two sites I removed are hardly the only local projects in which we've had a hand; we've built sites for local organizations and businesses like the [Boerne Chamber of Commerce](http://www.boerne.org "Boerne Chamber of Commerce"), [Boerne Rotary](http://www.boernerotary.org "Boerne Rotary"), [ADKF](http://www.adkf.com/ "ADKF"), [Mint](http://www.ohmint.com "Mint"), and [Flying Circle Bags](http://www.flyingcirclebags.com "Flying Circle Bags"). That's not to mention several others in the Hill Country or San Antonio areas.

A great deal of our initial and ongoing success has come from our involvement with these clients, and we are thankful to have relationships with them. The sphere in which we work allows us to have a clientele that is thousands of miles away, but we relish the chance to meet face-to-face with our local partners.

Our client roster is pretty impressive
--------------------------------------

I say that in reverential, not haughty, tones. In fact, part of what initially drew me to Digett was the list of heavy hitters for whom the company has worked. That list includes Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Derby, entertainment superstars like Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young and Jackson Browne, H-E-B, Schlumberger, Arizona State University, and more.

Those are good names to have on a resume, though we maintain that each client is equally important and impactful. If anything, our work with those above reinforces our belief that people and organizations of almost any size may benefit from our expertise and insights.

Digett's portfolio is just the tip of the iceberg
-------------------------------------------------

We only list a small handful of our work on that page, and that's for a number of reasons. For one, you come up against diminishing returns pretty quickly; nobody's going to page through hundreds of projects. Additionally, as I mentioned above, we've grown. Some of our previous work doesn't reflect our current capabilities. Digett continues to evolve, and our focus on [producing measurable insights](/2010/02/01/metrics-are-good-insight-better "producing measurable insights") rather than as a service provider is becoming clearer.

That said, we still recognize and appreciate every project we've tackled since 2001. We have great hopes and expectations for the next decade.
