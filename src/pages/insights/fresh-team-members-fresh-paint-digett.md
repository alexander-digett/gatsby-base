Success is bringing exciting changes to Digett. Not only have we added four new professionals to our team in the last five months, we’re giving the office a facelift, too.

If you’ve dropped by our location since July, you’ve likely been greeted by the friendly face of our new office manager Cindy Becker at the front desk. Cindy is a skilled bookkeeper and a fabulous coffee brewer. When you call us, she’s the happy voice on the other end of the line as well.

New to the Digett workroom think-tank are Andrew McClintock, Valarie Geckler, and a new developer starting soon.

Andrew comes aboard as Junior Designer, ready to expertly retouch photos and graphics and to design sites with the style and exceptional visual artistry Digett is known for.

Valarie joins Digett as Copywriter and Web Production Assistant to strengthen the firm’s turnkey web offerings with quality and creative copy, as well as provide support for projects and the information architecture development of sites.

Since our staff has grown to better suit our clients' needs, we thought it was a good time to make sure our office changed to better fit our personality. The beige and white walls and harsh fluorescents are out. For the New Year, we anticipate fresh paint on the walls, new light fixtures and new art so that our space is as fresh as the ideas we hammer out.

We're excited about our growth and thank everyone who has been a part of our success.
