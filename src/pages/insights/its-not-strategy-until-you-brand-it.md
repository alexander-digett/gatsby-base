Building your brand and preserving your reputation is crucial to you and your business. It takes hard work, but [there are no shortcuts to success](/insights/dig-your-own-grave-paid-reviews). Brand strategy is the cornerstone of who you are and what your company stands for. Components of your brand strategy are highly visible, highly recognizable, and can help your company speak to customers without saying a word.

This two-part series provides some insight to help you get started on your brand journey. And breaking down the parts of logo, message and tagline are just the first step.

It’s all about the logo
-----------------------

When it comes to brand, your logo is an important representative of your company: it’s your Executive, Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service departments all rolled into one.

It also has the highest visibility in your company. When I mention a prancing horse logo, what comes to mind? The Kentucky Derby, a ride in a hansom cab, or something else completely un-equestrian related? Add a splash of color by mentioning a black prancing horse and a yellow background and you are now able to add a little more context to the brand.

For those not familiar, this is the color palate and logo for Ferrari.

Ferrari sees itself as the most passionate, cutting-edge, technology leader in the world; the world sees Ferrari as the manufacturer of some of the sexiest, most collectable, and highest performing vehicles in the world.

Did I mention they are owned by Fiat, the same company that owns Dodge? The Formula1 and Hemi crowd don’t share many similarities; other than 4 tires and an engine, we’re comparing Grey Poupon to French’s Mustard in the automotive world.

Dodge doesn’t evoke the same style, finesse, and price premium that Ferrari conjures. And it shouldn’t — the audience is different. Both companies are passionate and both deliver on their brand promise. They just do it to while focusing on their respective audiences. Knowing your audience will help you develop a logo that stands for your company and speaks to your specific audience.

Get the message
---------------

Your brand messaging is what you want to communicate to the public, to customers, and to your employees. Perhaps this represents the level of service you provide or the technology incorporated into the products you build. If you are an industry leader in value, performance, or technology, share that in your message.

It’s this consistent messaging that everyone—from employees to partners to customers—should associate with you. It demonstrates what you stand for and how you perform. This message speaks to your passion and your expertise and it is supported by what your logo represents.

Tag, you’re it
--------------

A tagline is a concise statement that is not only meaningful, but also demonstrates the essence of your brand.

Ford Trucks is a great example. When Ford states, “Built Ford Tough,” it doesn’t take a whole lot of interpretation to understand and identify the meaning. Yes, trucks have to withstand daily abuse. They have to be rugged, and while they can be dressed up, they are meant to work dependably and flawlessly day in and day out.

Three words from Ford convey that their trucks are the toughest in the business.

When you are crafting a tagline, think of what speaks to both you and your audience. Simpler is better and leaves little room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation. Think classic versus faddish when crafting your tagline, and remember that more is less.
