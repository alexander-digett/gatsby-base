We are, at Digett, embarking on a journey of risk in the form of a new marketing campaign. We have accepted the challenge of attracting 100 attendees to the May 23 [Boerne Chamber of Commerce](http://www.boerne.org) networking breakfast. Normally we see between 40 and 60, so this represents a significant shift. But we think the goal is attainable through a little clever marketing. We've decided on creating a campaign combining web, video, and email to intrigue and attract. Stay tuned for details, and follow along with us on the trail ride toward what we hope to be a successful and truly enchanting breakfast.
