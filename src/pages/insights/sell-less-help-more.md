As a sales and marketing professional, your job is to attract and retain customers using every tool available: television spots, direct mail, cold calling, etc. Buzz about blogging and social media is huge, but all you can think is, “I’m already marketing. Why do I need content marketing?”

Times have changed
------------------

In recent years it has become impossible to read, watch, or listen to anything without also having to deal with advertising. Television commercials interrupt our movies, drive to work, our YouTube videos, and even our attempts to connect with friends or research products online.

Consequently we’ve done our best to invent things that bypass those irritations: Caller ID, DVR, XM Radio, and good old fashioned ignoring.

Consumers are sick of being sold to, and their trust in traditional advertising is fading. A [2012 Nielsen study](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2012/consumer-trust-in-online-social-and-mobile-advertising-grows.html) makes it plain:

*   Trust in television ads is down 24 percent
*   Trust in magazine ads is down 20 percent
*   Trust in newspaper ads is down 25 percent

On the other hand, the same Nielsen study showed an increase in trust when it came to online media:

*   70 percent trust online consumer reviews
*   Almost 50 percent trust information in emails they signed up to receive
*   92 percent consider recommendations from friends/family as trustworthy

There’s a better way
--------------------

Content marketing is centered around a single idea: if you produce and share useful content, you are more likely to attract new customers, keep current customers, and have them recommend you to their connections.

The balance is quickly shifting into the hands of the consumer. Smart brands embrace that, directing their marketing investment into producing content their community will happily download, bookmark, and share.

Where do I start?
