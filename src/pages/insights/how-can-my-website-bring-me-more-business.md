How much business was generated from your website in the last month? Did your website, your number one marketing tool, [your 24/7 salesperson](/insights/how-much-does-website-cost-why-30000-bargain) to the world, bring you new customers?

It’s common for us to hear prospects or clients provide reasons that they dislike their existing website. For example:

*   the design is _sooo_ 2008
*   it doesn’t reflect current product offerings anymore
*   it’s not very user-friendly

Every single one of those considerations are extremely important and should not be ignored, but here’s what you should be concerned with even more: **Does your website consistently bring you more business? If it doesn’t, then your website is broken.**

How can I make my website better?
---------------------------------

It’s important to know that there are ways to improve the performance of your site that may not necessarily mean the cost of a complete redesign. Good ongoing content offerings, good SEO and [good calls to action](/insights/content-generation-and-ctas-do-your-site-visitors-know-what-do-next) can exponentially increase the amount of business your website generates.

We packaged our tips on how to turn your site into a lead generation machine into PDF format. You can download our [Marketing Guide to Growth here](http://offer.digett.com/marketing-guide-growth).

If your 2008-designed, non-user-friendly, out-of-date product offering site is still bringing in consistent leads — great, then your website is working for you as it should. But the reverse is true, too. If your new, state-of-the-art site doesn’t bring in business, you’re not getting the ROI you deserve.
