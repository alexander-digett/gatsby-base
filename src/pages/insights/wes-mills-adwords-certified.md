Wes joined us in August as our Marketing Analyst intern, and has spent a good deal of the semester up to his eyeballs in Google AdWords and Analytics. But it paid off in October when he became a Google AdWords Qualified Individual!

Of course this is good news for Digett; but even more importantly, it’s good news for Wes. The study and test process for this certification is challenging, even for those who have previous experience with AdWords. Getting certified is a huge feather in Wes’ cap, and we’re excited to see what he does with it.

Congratulations again, Wes!
