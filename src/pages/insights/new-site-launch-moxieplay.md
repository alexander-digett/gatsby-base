MoxiePlay is the go-to website for women who love NFL football. Members are active on Facebook, but wanted an online hub where they could more easily talk teams, tailgating recipes, and maybe a little trash.

The goals of the [MoxiePlay](http://www.moxieplay.com/) site were numerous:

*   Create a place where both die-hard fans and those new to the sport would feel at home.
*   Integrate closely with social media so that MoxiePlay’s thirty thousand fans can easily pass through from Facebook and share content back to their friends.
*   Keep the freshest news prominent.
*   Make it easy for users to communicate and add their own content to the site.

Joining two audiences
---------------------

Whether they’ve been rabid fans since childhood or have never even seen a game, visitors to the MoxiePlay site always have something to do. Dedicated fans can argue the latest play on the forums, and football newbies can visit [Sports University](http://www.moxieplay.com/sports-university) to learn the history and rules of the sport.

Integrating with social media
-----------------------------

Because MoxiePlay’s presence began on Facebook, it was important that we give existing members a way to easily cross between the third-party site and the main website. Integrated social sharing makes it easy for members to share content to their personal networks.

Breaking sports news
--------------------

The homepage “Top News” section automatically pulls in the latest NFL news from around the web, keeping the site current and its members informed of breaking news. During pre-season and season games, a ticker along the top of the homepage displays the current games and their scores.

Building a community
--------------------

User-generated content is king on the MoxiePlay website. Once registered, members can start and join discussions on the forums, tag photos and images to team-related Flickr groups, submit tailgating recipes, and more. The “My MoxiePlay” portion of the website allows them to track the discussions in which they’re participating and make new friends.

The Drupal advantage
--------------------

Building the MoxiePlay site on [Drupal Commons](http://www.acquia.com/solutions/digital-experience-management/community) made it easy to provide MoxiePlay administrators with more baked-in features than we could have built in-house for the same budget. Drupal Commons also allowed us to streamline members’ actions and make it easy for them to create and share new content.

Welcome MoxiePlay!
------------------

We loved working with MoxiePlay to grow their online presence and make this site the ultimate online sports media connection for women. Football season officially kicks off September 5 — let’s make it a good one!
