I recently attended a Web development conference in Portland, Oregon. One session stood out for me as encouraging and as a good reminder as we go forward — [The Engineer, The Designer, The Dictator](http://portland2013.drupal.org/keynote/michael-lopp.html) by Michael Lopp. You need all three for a successful project.
