When it comes to subject lines for email campaigns or newsletters, word choice can make or break a subscriber's decision to open a message or not. There's no magic bullet for compelling a subscriber to open and read your newsletter, but ponder these ideas about subject lines before your next mail blast.

### The Three C's  

Marketing research suggests that subject lines that are concise, clear and provide a call to action are the most effective at grabbing the attention of people quickly scanning their inbox for interesting emails.

*   **What is considered concise?** Between three and six words. No need for a dissertation in the subject line.
    
*   **How clear is clear?** A title should be specific and relevant to content therein. Nothing prompts a reader to unsubscribe faster than the bait and switch.
    
*   **What are effective calls to action?** In most cases, it's simple - get readers reading. Try to appeal to subscribers' desires, needs and interests. Aim to motivate subscribers to read your campaign without being overly promotional, unless, of course, it is purely a promotion.
    

Not to give you flashbacks to high school grammar class, but verb choice can go a long way toward increasing your message's effective call to action. Consider the following example:

**Passive:** A Chance to Register for Pie is Inside

**Active:** Register Now to Win Pie

Active verbs and phrases can give that extra boost to an email. Avoid bland, passive verbs like "is," "are," "was," and "were."

### Don't Look Like Spam  

Avoid any wording (don't mention Viagra, for sure) or all caps lettering that may get you confused for spam or filtered into the junk bin.
