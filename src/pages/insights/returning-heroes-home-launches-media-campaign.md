We launched [Returning Heroes Home](http://returningheroeshome.org/) a month or so ago... maybe a couple months now. The Returning Heroes Home project is the creation of the folks over at [Huffman Developments](http://huffmandev.com/). For the past few days the project has received media coverage on several fronts.

From the beginning I found [Colin's simple and elegant design](http://returningheroeshome.org/) for this site simply perfect. We're glad to play a role in such a worthwhile project's success.

By the way, Colin designed the extremely cool logo, also.
