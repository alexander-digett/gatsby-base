Last week I ran across an article titled “Secrets to a Social Media Strategy.” It’s well-written and helpful, but unfortunately confuses strategy with tactics — and you need _both_ to properly engage with an online community.

[The article](http://www.inc.com/janine-popick/secrets-to-a-successful-social-media-strategy.html) does a great job of of informing readers that finding fodder for social media isn’t difficult as long as one knows where to look for inspiration:

*   Pictures and Videos
*   Press
*   Sales
*   Cool Articles
*   Save Time by Pre-Scheduling Posts

These are all marvelous ideas for places to find content (or in the case of number 5, to make sure you’re consistently sharing), but I want to emphasize that **this isn’t a social media strategy — it’s tactics.**

Spot the differences
--------------------

Tactics are sort of like that bag of nuts and bolts that comes with the “some assembly required” DVD display case you buy: they’re critical to holding everything together, but without an instruction manual you’re in trouble.

Let’s use the article’s first point—Pictures and Videos—as an example.

_“Research has shown that pictures or videos posted to social networks get the highest degree of engagement. The more people like, comment or retweet your pictures, the more new eyeballs your business might get exposed to.”_

Both facts are true, but before you start posting photos and videos (tactic), you need to consider who your audience is, what kind of content they want to see, and what will convince them to purchase (strategy).

Why strategy matters
--------------------

Strategy is both above and below tactics, forming a foundation on which to base your actions as well as umbrella under which every tactic must fall. It answers the _why_ and _how_, tactics the _what_. Strategy prevents you from wasting time on tactics that aren’t helping you, and gives you objectives on which to focus.

“Secrets to Social Media Strategy” suggests sharing links to interesting articles through your social media profile:

_“You're consuming articles and interesting things on your own social networks or publications you like...If you think it's worth reading, chances are your followers will, too.”_

But if you skip strategy and dive right into tactics, you run the risk of promoting Product A—what you _think_ is your best seller—when in reality your audience wants to hear out (and spend money) on Product B. Since you never mention it, they may assume it’s not something you offer and go elsewhere to make their purchase.

Don’t “think” you know what your prospects and customers want — take time to strategize and _know_.

Dig deeper than tactics
-----------------------

Tactics are the day-to-day activities (blogging, sharing, conversing, etc.) that keep your social media strategy moving forward, and are critical to long-term social media success. Strategy and tactics are part of the same package: without both in place your social media activity will not benefit you.
