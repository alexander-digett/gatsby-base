The holiday season is almost here, which means it’s time to start our search for our spring 2015 Digital Marketing, Digital Design, and Web Development interns. We’ve got exciting projects in the works, and we would love to have an intern team tackle them with us!

3 reasons to intern with Digett
-------------------------------

### Gain hands-on experience

Forget making coffee and fetching lunches. How about making a promotional video, designing an event program, or building a website?

If you want to learn what it’s really like to work for a digital marketing agency, this is your perfect opportunity.

### Work side-by-side with executive leadership

Have you ever interned somewhere and been stuck in a separate room with a bunch of other interns, working on meaningless busywork? We do things a little differently.

Our interns work side-by-side with our team on real-world projects, benefiting from our decades of digital marketing experience.

### Grow your portfolio

We work with you to help you complete projects that add to your portfolio, expanding your expertise and making you more attractive to potential employers.

What previous interns are saying
--------------------------------

“Being able to work with such a friendly team and a welcoming work environment...I instantly felt like I belonged from my first day.”

“It's nice to hear that you're doing a good job and that you're not taken advantage of because you're an intern. It helped boost my confidence as a designer.”

“The project was intimidating at first and I wasn't sure I would be able to complete it to \[Digett’s\] standards, but I ended up creating a pretty cool video! It is now something I can show off proudly on my portfolio.”

“...if I felt stuck or not sure what to do, there was always a lot of open communication with the team….when working individually, I felt I got to learn a lot and develop as a writer and marketer.”
